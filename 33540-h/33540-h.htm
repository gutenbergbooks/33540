<div class="sidenote">Accession of Edward I.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> the undisputed accession of a prince like Edward I. to the throne
of his father does not seem so convenient a resting-place in history as
one of those revolutions which interrupt the natural chain of events, yet
the changes wrought during his reign make it properly an epoch in the
progress of these inquiries. And, indeed, as ours is emphatically styled a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
government by king, lords, and commons, we cannot, perhaps, in
strictness carry it further back than the admission of the latter into
parliament; so that if the constant representation of the commons is to be
referred to the age of Edward I., it will be nearer the truth to date the
English constitution from that than from any earlier era.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confirmation of the Charters.</div>

<p>The various statutes affecting the law of property and administration of
justice which have caused Edward I. to be named, rather hyperbolically,
the English Justinian, bear no immediate relation to our present
inquiries. In a constitutional point of view the principal object is that
statute entitled the Confirmation of the Charters, which was very
reluctantly conceded by the king in the 25th year of his reign. I do not
know that England has ever produced any patriots to whose memory she owes
more gratitude than Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford and Essex, and Roger
Bigod, earl of Norfolk. In the Great Charter the base spirit and deserted
condition of John take off something from the glory of the triumph, though
they enhance the moderation of those who pressed no further upon an abject
tyrant. But to withstand the measures of Edward, a prince unequalled by
any who had reigned in England since the Conqueror, for prudence, valour,
and success, required a far more intrepid patriotism. Their provocations,
if less outrageous than those received from John, were such as evidently
manifested a disposition in Edward to reign without any control; a
constant refusal to confirm the charters, which in that age were hardly
deemed to bind the king without his actual consent; heavy impositions,
especially one on the export of wool, and other unwarrantable demands. He
had acted with such unmeasured violence towards the clergy, on account of
their refusal of further subsidies, that, although the ill-judged policy
of that class kept their interests too distinct from those of the people,
it was natural for all to be alarmed at the precedent of
despotism.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
These encroachments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
made resistance justifiable, and the circumstances of
Edward made it prudent. His ambition, luckily for the people, had involved
him in foreign warfare, from which he could not recede without
disappointment and dishonour. Thus was wrested from him that famous
statute, inadequately denominated the Confirmation of the Charters,
because it added another pillar to our constitution, not less important
than the Great Charter
itself.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>It was enacted by the 25 Edw. I. that the charter of liberties, and that
of the forest, besides being explicitly
confirmed,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
should be sent to
all sheriffs, justices in eyre, and other magistrates throughout the
realm, in order to their publication before the people; that copies of
them should be kept in cathedral churches, and publicly read twice in the
year, accompanied by a solemn sentence of excommunication against all who
should infringe them; that any judgment given contrary to these charters
should be invalid, and holden for nought. This authentic promulgation,
those awful sanctions of the Great Charter, would alone render the statute
of which we are speaking illustrious. But it went a great deal further.
Hitherto the king's prerogative of levying money by name of tallage or
prise from his towns and tenants in demesne had passed unquestioned. Some
impositions, that especially on the export of wool, affected all his
subjects. It was now the moment to enfranchise the people, and give that
security to private property which Magna Charta had given to personal
liberty. By the 5th and 6th sections of this statute "the aids, tasks, and
prises," before taken are renounced as precedents; and the king "grants
for him and his heirs, as well to archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors,
and other folk of holy church, as also to earls, barons, and to all
commonalty of the land, that for no business from henceforth we shall take
such manner of aids, tasks, nor prises, but by the common assent of the
realm,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and for the common profit thereof, saving the ancient aids and
prises due and accustomed." The toll upon wool, so far as levied by the
king's mere prerogative, is expressly released by the seventh
section.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Constitution of parliament.</div>

<p>We come now to a part of our subject exceedingly important, but more
intricate and controverted than any other, the constitution of parliament.
I have taken no notice of this in the last section, in order to present
uninterruptedly to the reader the gradual progress of our legislature down
to its complete establishment under the Edwards. No excuse need be made
for the dry and critical disquisition of the following pages; but among
such obscure inquiries I cannot feel myself as secure from error as I
certainly do from partiality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The spiritual peers.</div>

<p>One constituent branch of the great councils held by William the Conqueror
and all his successors was composed of the bishops and the heads of
religious houses holding their temporalities immediately of the crown. It
has been frequently maintained that these spiritual lords sat in
parliament only by virtue of their baronial tenure. And certainly they did
all hold baronies, which, according to the analogy of lay peerages, were
sufficient to give them such a share in the legislature. Nevertheless, I
think that this is rather too contracted a view of the rights of the
English hierarchy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and, indeed, by implication, of the peerage. For a
great council of advice and assent in matters of legislation or national
importance was essential to all the northern governments. And all of them,
except, perhaps, the Lombards, invited the superior ecclesiastics to their
councils; not upon any feudal notions, which at that time had hardly begun
to prevail, but chiefly as representatives of the church and of religion
itself; next, as more learned and enlightened counsellors than the lay
nobility; and in some degree, no doubt, as rich proprietors of land. It
will be remembered also that ecclesiastical and temporal affairs were
originally decided in the same assemblies, both upon the continent and in
England. The Norman Conquest, which destroyed the Anglo-Saxon nobility,
and substituted a new race in their stead, could not affect the
immortality of church possessions. The bishops of William's age were
entitled to sit in his councils by the general custom of Europe, and by
the common law of England, which the Conquest did not
overturn.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> Some
smaller arguments might be urged against the supposition that their
legislative rights are merely baronial; such as that the guardian of the
spiritualities was commonly summoned to parliament during the vacancy of a
bishopric, and that the five sees created by Henry VIII. have no baronies
annexed to
them;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
but the former reasoning appears less technical and
confined.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>Next to these spiritual lords are the earls and barons, or lay peerage of
England. The former dignity was, perhaps, not so merely official as in the
Saxon times, although the earl was entitled to the third penny of all
emoluments arising from the administration of justice in the
county-courts, and might, perhaps, command the militia of his county, when
it was called
forth.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> earl was also a baron, and held an honour
or barony of the crown, for which he paid a higher relief than an ordinary
baron, probably on account of the profits of his earldom. I will not
pretend to say whether titular earldoms, absolutely distinct from the
lieutenancy of a county, were as ancient as the Conquest, which Madox
seems to think, or were considered as irregular so late as Henry II.,
according to Lord Lyttelton. In Dugdale's Baronage I find none of this
description in the first Norman reigns; for even that of Clare was
connected with the local earldom of Hertford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question as to the nature of baronies.</div>

<p>It is universally agreed that the only baronies known for two centuries
after the Conquest were incident to the tenure of land held immediately
from the crown. There are, however, material difficulties in the way of
rightly understanding their nature which ought not to be passed over,
because the consideration of baronial tenures will best develop the
formation of our parliamentary system. Two of our most eminent legal
antiquaries, Selden and Madox, have entertained different opinions as to
the characteristics and attributes of this tenure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory of Selden;</div>

<p>According to the first, every tenant in chief by knight-service was an
honorary or parliamentary baron by reason of his tenure. All these were
summoned to the king's councils, and were peers of his court. Their
baronies, or honours, as they were frequently called, consisted of a
number of knight's fees; that is, of estates, from each of which the
feudal service of a knight was due; not fixed to thirteen fees and a
third, as has been erroneously conceived, but varying according to the
extent of the barony and the reservation of service at the time of its
creation. Were they more or fewer, however, their owner was equally a
baron, and summoned to serve the king in parliament with his advice and
judgment, as appears by many records and passages in history.</p>

<p>But about the latter end of John's reign, some only of the most eminent
tenants in chief were summoned by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
particular writs; the rest by one
general summons through the sheriffs of their several counties. This is
declared in the Great Charter of that prince, wherein he promises that,
whenever an aid or scutage shall be required, faciemus summoneri
archiepiscopos, episcopos, abbates, comites et majores barones regni
sigillatim per literas nostras. Et pr√¶terea faciemus summoneri in generali
per vicecomites et ballivos nostros omnes alios qui in capite tenent de
nobis. Thus the barons are distinguished from other tenants in chief, as
if the former name were only applicable to a particular number of the
king's immediate vassals. But it is reasonable to think that, before this
charter was made, it had been settled by the law of some other parliament,
how these greater barons should be distinguished from the lesser tenants
in chief; else what certainty could there be in an expression so general
and indefinite? And this is likely to have proceeded from the pride with
which the ancient and wealthy barons of the realm would regard those newly
created by grants of escheated honours, or those decayed in estate, who
yet were by their tenures on an equality with themselves. They procured
therefore two innovations in their condition; first that these inferior
barons should be summoned generally by the sheriff, instead of receiving
their particular writs, which made an honorary distinction; and next, that
they should pay relief, not, as for an entire barony, one hundred marks;
but at the rate of five pounds for each knight's fee which they held of
the crown. This changed their tenure to one by mere knight-service, and
their denomination to tenants in chief. It was not difficult, afterwards,
for the greater barons to exclude any from coming to parliament as such
without particular writs directed to them, for which purpose some law was
probably enacted in the reign of Henry III. If indeed we could place
reliance on a nameless author whom Camden has quoted, this limitation of
the peerage to such as were expressly summoned depended upon a statute
made soon after the battle of Evesham. But no one has ever been able to
discover Camden's authority, and the change was, probably, of a much
earlier date.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">of Madox,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and observations on both.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Such is the theory of Selden, which, if it rested less upon conjectural
alterations in the law, would undoubtedly solve some material difficulties
that occur in the opposite view of the subject. According to Madox, tenure
by knight-service in chief was always distinct from that by barony. It is
not easy, however, to point out the characteristic differences of the two;
nor has that eminent antiquary, in his large work, the Baronia Anglica,
laid down any definition, or attempted to explain the real nature of a
barony. The distinction could not consist in the number of knight's fees;
for the barony of Hwayton consisted of only three; while John de Baliol
held thirty fees by mere
knight-service.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Nor does it seem to have
consisted in the privilege or service of attending parliament, since all
tenants in chief were usually summoned. But whatever may have been the
line between these modes of tenure, there seems complete proof of their
separation long before the reign of John. Tenants in chief are enumerated
distinctly from earls and barons in the charter of Henry I. Knights, as
well as barons, are named as present in the parliament of Northampton in
1165, in that held at the same town in 1176, and upon other
occasions.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Several persons appear in the Liber Niger Scaccarii, a roll of military
tenants made in the age of Henry II., who held single knight's fees of the
crown. It is, however, highly probable, that, in a lax sense of the word,
these knights may sometimes have been termed barons. The author of the
Dialogus de Scaccario speaks of those holding greater or lesser baronies,
including, as appears by the context, all tenants in
chief.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> The former
of these seem to be the majores barones of King John's Charter. And the
secund√¶ dignitatis barones, said by a contemporary historian to have been
present in the parliament of Northampton, were in all probability no other
than the knightly tenants of the
crown.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
For the word baro, originally meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
only a man, was of very large significance, and is not
unfrequently applied to common freeholders, as in the phrase of
court-baron. It was used too for the magistrates or chief men of cities,
as it is still for the judges of the exchequer, and the representatives of
the Cinque
Ports.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<p>The passage however before cited from the Great Charter of John affords
one spot of firm footing in the course of our progress. Then, at least, it
is evident that all tenants in chief were entitled to their summons; the
greater barons by particular writs, the rest through one directed to their
sheriff. The epoch when all, who, though tenants in chief, had not been
actually summoned, were deprived of their right of attendance in
parliament, is again involved in uncertainty and conjecture. The unknown
writer quoted by Camden seems not sufficient authority to establish his
assertion, that they were excluded by a statute made after the battle of
Evesham. The principle was most likely acknowledged at an earlier time.
Simon de Montfort summoned only twenty-three temporal peers to his famous
parliament. In the year 1255 the barons complained that many of their
number had not received their writs according to the tenor of the charter,
and refused to grant an aid to the king till they were
issued.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> But it
would have been easy to disappoint this mode of packing a parliament, if
an unsummoned baron could have sat by mere right of his tenure. The
opinion of Selden, that a law of exclusion was enacted towards the
beginning of Henry's reign is not liable to so much objection. But perhaps
it is unnecessary to frame an hypothesis of this nature. Writs of summons
seem to have been older than the time of
John;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
and when this had
become the customary and regular preliminary of a baron's coming to
parliament, it was a natural transition to look upon it as an
indispensable condition; in times when the prerogative was high, the law
unsettled, and the service in parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
deemed by many still more
burthensome than honourable. Some omissions in summoning the king's
tenants to former parliaments may perhaps have produced the
above-mentioned provision of the Great Charter, which had a relation to
the imposition of taxes wherein it was deemed essential to obtain a more
universal consent than was required in councils held for state, or even
for advice.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[s]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether mere tenants in chief attended parliament under Henry
III.</div>

<p>It is not easy to determine how long the inferior tenants in chief
continued to sit personally in parliament. In the charters of Henry III.,
the clause which we have been considering is omitted: and I think there is
no express proof remaining that the sheriff was ever directed to summon
the king's military tenants within his county, in the manner which the
charter of John required. It appears however that they were in fact
members of parliament on many occasions during Henry's reign, which shows
that they were summoned either by particular writs or through the sheriff;
and the latter is the more plausible conjecture. There is indeed great
obscurity as to the constitution of parliament in this reign; and the
passages which I am about to produce may lead some to conceive that the
freeholders were <i>represented</i> even from its beginning. I rather incline
to a different opinion.</p>

<p>In the Magna Charta of 1 Henry III. it is said: Pro h√¢c donatione et
concessione ... archiepiscopi, episcopi, comites, barones, milites, et
liber√® tenentes, et omnes de regno nostro, dederunt nobis quintam decimam
partem omnium bonorum suorum
mobilium.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
So in a record of 19 Henry
III.: Comites, et barones, et omnes alii de toto regno nostro Angli√¶,
spontane√¢ voluntate su√¢, concesserunt nobis efficax
auxilium.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> The
largeness of these words is, however, controlled by a subsequent passage,
which declares the tax to be imposed ad mandatum omnium comitum et baronum
et omnium aliorum <i>qui de nobis tenent in capite</i>. And it seems to have
been a general practice to assume the common consent of all ranks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> to that
which had actually been agreed by the higher. In a similar writ, 21 Henry
III., the rants of men are enumerated specifically; archiepiscopi,
episcopi, abbates, priores, et clerici terras habentes qu√¶ ad ecclesias
suas non pertinent, comites, barones, milites, et liberi homines, pro se
et suis villanis, nobis concesserunt in auxilium tricesimam partem omnium
mobilium.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
In the close roll of the same year, we have a writ directed
to the archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons, knights, and
freeholders (liberi homines) of Ireland, in which an aid is desired of
them, and it is urged that one had been granted by his fideles
Angli√¶.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<p>But this attendance in parliament of inferior tenants in chief, some of
them too poor to have received knighthood, grew insupportably vexatious to
themselves, and was not well liked by the king. He knew them to be
dependent upon the barons, and dreaded the confluence of a multitude, who
assumed the privilege of coming in arms to the appointed place. So
inconvenient and mischievous a scheme could not long subsist among an
advancing people, and fortunately the true remedy was discovered with
little difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin and progress of parliamentary representation.</div>

<p>The principle of representation, in its widest sense, can hardly be
unknown to any government not purely democratical. In almost every country
the sense of the whole is understood to be spoken by a part, and the
decisions of a part are binding upon the whole. Among our ancestors the
lord stood in the place of his vassals, and, still more unquestionably,
the abbot in that of his monks. The system indeed of ecclesiastical
councils, considered as organs of the church, rested upon the principle of
a virtual or an express representation, and had a tendency to render its
application to national assemblies more familiar.</p>

<p>The first instance of actual representation which occurs in our history is
only four years after the Conquest; when William, if we may rely on
Hoveden, caused twelve persons skilled in the customs of England to be
chosen from each county, who were sworn to inform him rightly of their
laws; and these, so ascertained, were ratified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
by the consent of the
great council. This, Sir Matthew Hale asserts to be "as sufficient and
effectual a parliament as ever was held in
England."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
But there is no
appearance that these twelve deputies of each county were invested with
any higher authority than that of declaring their ancient usages. No
stress can be laid at least on this insulated and anomalous assembly, the
existence of which is only learned from an historian of a century
later.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>We find nothing that can arrest our attention, in searching out the origin
of county representation, till we come to a writ in the fifteenth year of
John, directed to all the sheriffs in the following terms: Rex Vicecomiti
N., salutem. Pr√¶cipimus tibi quod omnes milites balliv√¶ tu√¶ qui summoniti
fuerunt esse apud Oxoniam ad Nos a die Omnium Sanctorum in quindecim dies
venire facias cum armis suis: corpora vero baronum sine armis
singulariter, et <i>quatuor discretos milites</i> de comitatu tuo, illuc venire
facias ad eundem terminum, ad loquendum nobiscum de negotiis regni nostri.
For the explanation of this obscure writ I must refer to what Prynne has
said;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
but it remains problematical whether these four knights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> (the
only clause which concerns our purpose) were to be elected by the county
or returned in the nature of a jury, at the discretion of the sheriff.
Since there is no sufficient proof whereon to decide, we can only say with
hesitation, that there <i>may</i> have been an instance of county
representation in the fifteenth year of John.</p>

<p>We may next advert to a practice, of which there is very clear proof in
the reign of Henry III. Subsidies granted in parliament were assessed, not
as in former times by the justices upon their circuits, but by knights
freely chosen in the county court. This appears by two writs, one of the
fourth and one of the ninth year of Henry
III.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
At a subsequent period,
by a provision of the Oxford parliament in 1258, every county elected four
knights to inquire into grievances, and deliver their inquisition into
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>The next writ now extant, that wears the appearance of parliamentary
representation, is in the thirty-eighth of Henry III. This, after reciting
that the earls, barons, and other great men (c√¶teri magnates) were to meet
at London three weeks after Easter, with horses and arms, for the purpose
of sailing into Gascony, requires the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
sheriff to compel all within his
jurisdiction, who hold twenty pounds a year of the king in chief, or of
those in ward of the king, to appear at the same time and place. And that
besides those mentioned he shall cause to come before the king's council
at Westminster, on the fifteenth day after Easter, two good and discreet
knights of his county, whom the men of the county shall have chosen for
this purpose, in the stead of all and each of them, to consider, along
with the knights of other counties, what aid they will grant the king in
such an emergency.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
In the principle of election, and in the object of
the assembly, which was to grant money, this certainly resembles a summons
to parliament. There are indeed anomalies sufficiently remarkable upon the
face of the writ which distinguish this meeting from a regular parliament.
But when the scheme of obtaining money from the commons of shires through
the consent of their representatives had once been entertained, it was
easily applicable to more formal councils of the
nation.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

<p>A few years later there appears another writ analogous to a summons.
During the contest between Henry III. and the confederate barons in 1261,
they presumed to call a sort of parliament, summoning three knights out of
every county, secum tractaturos super communibus negotiis regni. This we
learn only by an opposite writ issued by the king, directing the sheriff
to enjoin these knights who had been convened by the earls of Leicester
and Gloucester to their meeting at St. Alban's, that they should repair
instead to the king at Windsor, and to no other place, nobiscum super
pr√¶missis colloquium
habituros.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
It is not absolutely certain that
these knights were elected by their respective counties. But even if they
were so, this assembly has much less the appearance of a parliament, than
that in the thirty-eighth of Henry III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
At length, in the year 1265, the forty-ninth of Henry III., while he was a
captive in the hands of Simon de Montfort, writs were issued in his name
to all the sheriffs, directing them to return two knights for the body of
their county, with two citizens or burgesses for every city and borough
contained within it. This therefore is the epoch at which the
representation of the commons becomes indisputably manifest; even should
we reject altogether the more equivocal instances of it which have just
been enumerated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether the knights were elected by freeholders in general.</div>

<p>If indeed the knights were still elected by none but the king's military
tenants, if the mode of representation was merely adopted to spare them
the inconvenience of personal attendance, the immediate innovation in our
polity was not very extensive. This is an interesting, but very obscure,
topic of inquiry. Spelman and Brady, with other writers, have restrained
the original right of election to tenants in chief, among whom, in process
of time, those holding under mesne lords, not being readily
distinguishable in the hurry of an election, contrived to slide in, till
at length their encroachments were rendered legitimate by the statute 7
Hen. IV. c. 15, which put all suitors to the county court on an equal
footing as to the elective franchise. The argument on this side might be
plausibly urged with the following reasoning.</p>

<p>The spirit of a feudal monarchy, which compelled every lord to act by the
advice and assent of his immediate vassals, established no relation
between him and those who held nothing at his hands. They were included,
so far as he was concerned, in their superiors; and the feudal incidents
were due to him from the whole of his vassal's fief, whatever tenants
might possess it by subinfeudation. In England the tenants in chief alone
were called to the great councils before representation was thought of, as
is evident both by the charter of John, and by the language of many
records; nor were any others concerned in levying aids or escuages, which
were only due by virtue of their tenure. These military tenants were
become, in the reign of Henry III., far more numerous than they had been
under the Conqueror. If we include those who held of the king ut de
honore, that is, the tenants of baronies escheated or in ward, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> may
probably have enjoyed the same privileges, being subject in general to the
same burdens, their number will be greatly augmented, and form no
inconsiderable portion of the freeholders of the kingdom. After the
statute commonly called Quia emptores in the eighteenth of Edward I. they
were likely to increase much more, as every licensed alienation of any
portion of a fief by a tenant in chief would create a new freehold
immediately depending upon the crown. Many of these tenants in capite held
very small fractions of knight's fees, and were consequently not called
upon to receive knighthood. They were plain freeholders holding in chief,
and the liberi homines or libere tenentes of those writs which have been
already quoted. The common form indeed of writs to the sheriff directs the
knights to be chosen de communitate comitat√ªs. But the word communitas, as
in boroughs, denotes only the superior part: it is not unusual to find
mention in records of communitas populi or omnes de regno, where none are
intended but the barons, or at most the tenants in chief. If we look
attentively at the earliest instance of summoning knights of shires to
parliament, that in 38 Henry III., which has been noticed above, it will
appear that they could only have been chosen by military tenants in chief.
The object of calling this parliament, if parliament it were, was to
obtain an aid from the military tenants, who, holding less than a knight's
fee, were not required to do personal service. None then, surely, but the
tenants in chief could be electors upon this occasion, which merely
respected their feudal duties. Again, to come much lower down, we find a
series of petitions in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II., which
seem to lead us to a conclusion that only tenants in chief were
represented by the knights of shires. The writ for wages directed the
sheriff to levy them on the commons of the county, both within franchises
and without (tam intra libertates quam extra). But the tenants of lords
holding by barony endeavoured to exempt themselves from this burthen, in
which they seem to have been countenanced by the king. This led to
frequent remonstrances from the commons, who finally procured a statute,
that all lands which had been accustomed to contribute towards the wages
of members should continue to do so, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
though they should be purchased
by a lord.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
But, if these mesne tenants had possessed equal rights of
voting with tenants in chief, it is impossible to conceive that they would
have thought of claiming so unreasonable an exemption. Yet, as it would
appear harsh to make any distinction between the rights of those who
sustained an equal burthen, we may perceive how the freeholders holding of
mesne lords might on that account obtain after the statute a participation
in the privilege of tenants in chief. And without supposing any partiality
or connivance, it is easy to comprehend that, while the nature of tenures
and services was so obscure as to give rise to continual disputes, of
which the ancient records of the King's Bench are full, no sheriff could
be very accurate in rejecting the votes of common freeholders repairing to
the county court, and undistinguishable, as must be allowed, from tenants
in capite upon other occasions, such as serving on juries, or voting on
the election of coroners. To all this it yields some corroboration, that a
neighbouring though long hostile kingdom, who borrowed much of her law
from our own, has never admitted any freeholders, except tenants in chief
of the crown, to a suffrage in county elections. These attended the
parliament of Scotland in person till 1428, when a law of James I.
permitted them to send
representatives.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<p>Such is, I think, a fair statement of the arguments that might be alleged
by those who would restrain the right of election to tenants of the crown.
It may be urged on the other side that the genius of the feudal system was
never completely displayed in England; much less can we make use of that
policy to explain institutions that prevailed under Edward I. Instead of
aids and scutages levied upon the king's military tenants, the crown found
ample resources in subsidies upon moveables, from which no class of men
was exempted. But the statute that abolished all unparliamentary taxation
led, at least in theoretical principle, to extend the elective franchise
to as large a mass of the people as could conveniently exercise it. It was
even in the mouth of our kings that what concerned all should be approved
by all. Nor is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the language of all extant writs less adverse to the
supposition that the right of suffrage in county elections was limited to
tenants in chief. It seems extraordinary that such a restriction, if it
existed, should never be deducible from these instruments; that their
terms should invariably be large enough to comprise all freeholders. Yet
no more is ever required of the sheriff than to return two knights chosen
by the body of the county. For they are not only said to be returned pro
communitate, but "per communitatem," and "de assensu totius communitatis."
Nor is it satisfactory to allege, without any proof, that this word should
be restricted to the tenants in chief, contrary to what must appear to be
its obvious
meaning.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Certainly, if these tenants of the crown had
found inferior freeholds usurping a right of suffrage, we might expect to
find it the subject of some legislative provision, or at least of some
petition and complaint. And, on the other hand, it would have been
considered as unreasonable to levy the wages due to knights of the shire
for their service in parliament on those who had no share in their
election. But it appears by writs at the very beginning of Edward II.'s
reign, that wages were levied "de communitate
comitatus."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> It will
scarcely be contended that no one was to contribute under this writ but
tenants in chief; and yet the word communitas can hardly be applied to
different persons, when it occurs in the same instrument and upon the same
matter. The series of petitions above mentioned relative to the payment of
wages rather tends to support a conclusion that all mesne tenants had the
right of suffrage, if they thought fit to exercise it, since it was
earnestly contended that they were liable to contribute towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> that
expense. Nor does there appear any reason to doubt that all freeholders,
except those within particular franchises, were suitors to the county
court&mdash;an institution of no feudal nature, and in which elections were to
be made by those present. As to the meeting to which knights of shires
were summoned in 38 Henry III., it ought not to be reckoned a parliament,
but rather one of those anomalous conventions which sometimes occurred in
the unfixed state of government. It is at least the earliest known
instance of representation, and leads us to no conclusion in respect of
later times, when the commons had become an essential part of the
legislature, and their consent was required to all public burthens.</p>

<p>This question, upon the whole, is certainly not free from considerable
difficulty. The legal antiquaries are divided. Prynne does not seem to
have doubted but that the knights were "elected in the full county, by and
for the whole county," without respect to the tenure of the
freeholders.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
But Brady and Carte are of a different opinion.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> Yet
their disposition to narrow the basis of the constitution is so strong,
that it creates a sort of prejudice against their authority. And if I
might offer an opinion on so obscure a subject, I should be much inclined
to believe that, even from the reign of Henry III., the election of
knights by all freeholders in the county-court, without regard to tenure,
was little, if at all, different from what it is at
present.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of towns.</div>

<p>The progress of towns in several continental countries, from a condition
bordering upon servitude to wealth and liberty, has more than once
attracted our attention in other parts of the present work. Their growth
in England, both from general causes and imitative policy, was very
similar and nearly coincident. Under the Anglo-Saxon line of sovereigns we
scarcely can discover in our scanty records the condition of their
inhabitants, except retrospectively from the great survey of Domesday
Book, which displays the state of England under Edward the Confessor. Some
attention to commerce had been shown by Alfred and Athelstan; and a
merchant who had made three voyages beyond sea was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
raised by law of the
latter monarch to the dignity of a
Thane.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
This privilege was not
perhaps often claimed; but the burgesses of towns were already a distinct
class from the ceorls or rustics, and, though hardly free according to our
estimation, seem to have laid the foundation of more extensive immunities.
It is probable, at least, that the English towns had made full as great
advances towards emancipation as those of France. At the Conquest we find
the burgesses or inhabitants of towns living under the superiority or
protection of the king, or of some other lord, to whom they paid annual
rents, and determinate dues or customs. Sometimes they belonged to
different lords, and sometimes the same burgess paid customs to one
master, while he was under the jurisdiction of another. They frequently
enjoyed special privileges as to inheritance; and in two or three
instances they seem to have possessed common property, belonging to a sort
of guild or corporation, and in some instances, perhaps, had a municipal
administration by magistrates of their own
choice.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
Besides the regular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
payments, which were in general not heavy, they were liable to
tallages at the discretion of their lords. This burthen continued for two
centuries, with no limitation, except that the barons were latterly forced
to ask permission of the king before they set a tallage on their tenants,
which was commonly done when he imposed one upon his
own.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> Still the
towns became considerably richer; for the profits of their traffic were
undiminished by competition, and the consciousness that they could not be
individually despoiled of their possessions, like the villeins of the
country around, inspired an industry and perseverance which all the
rapacity of Norman kings and barons was unable to daunt or overcome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towns let in fee-farm.</div>

<p>One of the earliest and most important changes in the condition of the
burgesses was the conversion of their individual tributes into a perpetual
rent from the whole borough. The town was then said to be affirmed, or let
in fee-farm, to the burgesses and their successors for
ever.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
Previously to such a grant the lord held the town in his demesne, and was
the legal proprietor of the soil and tenements; though I by no means
apprehend that the burgesses were destitute of a certain estate in their
possessions. But of a town in fee-farm he only kept the superiority and
the inheritance of the annual rent, which he might recover by
distress.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
The burgesses held their lands by burgage-tenure, nearly
analogous to, or rather a species of, free
socage.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
Perhaps before the
grant they might correspond to modern copyholders. It is of some
importance to observe that the lord, by such a grant of the town in
fee-farm, whatever we may think of its previous condition, divested
himself of his property,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
or lucrative dominion over the soil, in return
for the perpetual rent; so that tallages subsequently set at his own
discretion upon the inhabitants, however common, can hardly be considered
as a just exercise of the rights of proprietorship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charters of incorporation.</div>

<p>Under such a system of arbitrary taxation, however, it was evident to the
most selfish tyrant that the wealth of his burgesses was his wealth, and
their prosperity his interest; much more were liberal and sagacious
monarchs, like Henry II., inclined to encourage them by privileges. From
the time of William Rufus there was no reign in which charters were not
granted to different towns of exemption from tolls on rivers and at
markets, those lighter manacles of feudal tyranny; or of commercial
franchises; or of immunity from the ordinary jurisdictions; or, lastly, of
internal self-regulation. Thus the original charter of Henry I. to the
city of London<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
concedes to the citizens, in addition to valuable
commercial and fiscal immunities, the right of choosing their own sheriff
and justice, to the exclusion of every foreign
jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> These
grants, however, were not in general so extensive till the reign of
John.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Before that time the interior arrangement of towns had received
a new organization. In the Saxon period we find voluntary associations,
sometimes religious, sometimes secular; in some cases for mutual defence
against injury, in others for mutual relief in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
poverty. These were called
guilds, from the Saxon verb <i>gildan</i>, to pay or contribute, and exhibited
the natural, if not the legal, character of
corporations.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> At the time
of the Conquest, as has been mentioned above, such voluntary
incorporations of the burgesses possessed in some towns either landed
property of their own, or rights of superiority over that of others. An
internal elective government seems to have been required for the
administration of a common revenue, and of other business incident to
their association.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
They became more numerous and more peculiarly
commercial after that era, as well from the increase of trade as through
imitation of similar fraternities existing in many towns of France. The
spirit of monopoly gave strength to those institutions, each class of
traders forming itself into a body, in order to exclude competition. Thus
were established the companies in corporate towns, that of the Weavers in
London being perhaps the
earliest;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
and these were successively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
consolidated and sanctioned by charters from the crown. In towns not large
enough to admit of distinct companies, one merchant guild comprehended the
traders in general, or the chief of them; and this, from the reign of
Henry II. downwards, became the subject of incorporating charters. The
management of their internal concerns, previously to any incorporation,
fell naturally enough into a sort of oligarchy, which the tenor of the
charter generally preserved. Though the immunities might be very
extensive, the powers were more or less restrained to a small number.
Except in a few places, the right of choosing magistrates was first given
by king John; and certainly must rather be ascribed to his poverty than to
any enlarged policy, of which he was utterly
incapable.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Prosperity of English towns.</div>

<div class="sidenote">London.</div>

<p>From the middle of the twelfth century to that of the thirteenth the
traders of England became more and more prosperous. The towns on the
southern coast exported tin and other metals in exchange for the wines of
France; those on the eastern sent corn to Norway&mdash;the Cinque Ports
bartered wool against the stuffs of
Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> Though bearing no
comparison with the cities of Italy or the Empire, they increased
sufficiently to acquire importance at home. That vigorous prerogative of
the Norman monarchs, which kept down the feudal aristocracy, compensated
for whatever inferiority there might be in the population and defensible
strength of the English towns, compared with those on the continent. They
had to fear no petty oppressors, no local hostility; and if they could
satisfy the rapacity of the crown, were secure from all other grievances.
London, far above the rest, our ancient and noble capital, might, even in
those early times, be justly termed a member of the political system. This
great city, so admirably situated, was rich and populous long before the
Conquest. Bede, at the beginning of the eighth century, speaks of London
as a great market, which traders frequented by land and
sea.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> It paid
15,000<i>l.</i> out of 82,000<i>l.</i>, raised by Canute upon the
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> If we
believe Roger Hoveden, the citizens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of London, on the death of Ethelred
II., joined with part of the nobility in raising Edmund Ironside to the
throne.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
Harold I., according to better authority, the Saxon Chronicle
and William of Malmsbury, was elected by their
concurrence.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> Descending
to later history, we find them active in the civil war of Stephen and
Matilda. The famous bishop of Winchester tells the Londoners that they are
almost accounted as noblemen on account of the greatness of their city;
into the community of which it appears that some barons had been
received.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Indeed, the citizens themselves, or at least the principal
of them, were called barons. It was certainly by far the greatest city in
England. There have been different estimates of its population, some of
which are extravagant; but I think it could hardly have contained less
than thirty or forty thousand souls within its walls; and the suburbs were
very populous.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
These numbers, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
enjoyment of privileges, and the
consciousness of strength, infused a free and even a mutinous spirit into
their conduct.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
The Londoners were always on the barons' side in their
contests with the crown. They bore a part in deposing William Longchamp,
the chancellor and justiciary of Richard
I.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
They were distinguished in
the great struggle for Magna Charta; the privileges of their city are
expressly confirmed in it; and the mayor of London was one of the
twenty-five barons to whom the maintenance of its provisions was
delegated. In the subsequent reign the citizens of London were regarded
with much dislike and jealousy by the court, and sometimes suffered pretty
severely at its hands, especially after the battle of
Evesham.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the influence of London in these seasons of disturbance,
we do not perceive that it was distinguished from the most insignificant
town by greater participation in national councils. Rich, powerful,
honourable, and high-spirited as its citizens had become,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> it was very
long before they found a regular place in parliament. The prerogative of
imposing tallages at pleasure, unsparingly exercised by Henry III. even
over London,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
left the crown no inducement to summon the inhabitants of
cities and boroughs. As these indeed were daily growing more considerable,
they were certain, in a monarchy so limited as that of England became in
the thirteenth century, of attaining, sooner or later, this eminent
privilege. Although therefore the object of Simon de Montfort in calling
them to his parliament after the battle of Lewes was merely to strengthen
his own faction, which prevailed among the commonalty, yet, their
permanent admission into the legislature may be ascribed to a more general
cause. For otherwise it is not easy to see why the innovation of an
usurper should have been drawn into precedent, though it might perhaps
accelerate what the course of affairs was gradually preparing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First summoning of towns to parliament, in 49 H. III.</div>

<p>It is well known that the earliest writs of summons to cities and
boroughs, of which we can prove the existence, are those of Simon de
Montfort, earl of Leicester, bearing date 12th of December, 1264, in the
forty-ninth year of Henry
III.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
After a long controversy almost all
judicious inquirers seem to have acquiesced in admitting this origin of
popular representation.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
The argument may be very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
concisely stated. We
find from innumerable records that the king imposed tallages upon his
demesne towns at
discretion.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
No public instrument previous to the
forty-ninth of Henry III. names the citizens and burgesses as constituent
parts of parliament; though prelates, barons, knights, and sometimes
freeholders, are
enumerated;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
while, since the undoubted admission of
the commons, they are almost invariably mentioned. No historian speaks of
representatives appearing for the people, or uses the word citizen or
burgess in describing those present in parliament. Such convincing, though
negative, evidence is not to be invalidated by some general and ambiguous
phrases, whether in writs and records or in
historians.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> Those monkish
annalists are poor authorities upon any point where their language is to
be delicately measured. But it is hardly possible that, writing
circumstantially, as Roger de Hoveden and Matthew Paris sometimes did,
concerning proceedings in parliament, they could have failed to mention
the commons in unequivocal expressions, if any representatives from that
order had actually formed a part of the assembly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Authorities in favour of an earlier date. St. Albans.</div>

<p>Two authorities, however, which had been supposed to prove a greater
antiquity than we have assigned to the representation of the commons, are
deserving of particular consideration; the cases of St. Albans and
Barnstaple. The burgesses of St. Albans complained to the council in the
eighth year of Edward II., that, although they held of the king in capite,
and ought to attend his parliaments whenever they are summoned, by two of
their number, instead of all other services, as had been their custom in
all past times, which services the said burgesses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> their predecessors
had performed as well in the time of the late king Edward and his
ancestors as in that of the present king until the parliament now sitting,
the names of their deputies having been constantly enrolled in chancery,
yet the sheriff of Hertfordshire, at the instigation of the abbot of St.
Albans, had neglected to cause an election and return to be made; and
prayed remedy. To this petition it was answered, "Let the rolls of
chancery be examined, that it may appear whether the said burgesses were
accustomed to come to parliament, or not, in the time of the king's
ancestors; and let right be done to them, vocatis evocandis, si necesse
fuerit." I do not translate these words, concerning the sense of which
there has been some dispute, though not, apparently, very material to the principal
subject.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[z]</a></p>

<p>This is, in my opinion, by far the most plausible testimony for the early
representation of boroughs. The burgesses of St. Albans claim a
prescriptive right from the usage of all past times, and more especially
those of the late Edward and his ancestors. Could this be alleged, it has
been said, of a privilege at the utmost of fifty years' standing, once
granted by an usurper, in the days of the late king's father, and
afterwards discontinued till about twenty years before the date of their
petition, according to those who refer the regular appearance of the
commons in parliament to the twenty-third of Edward I.? Brady, who
obviously felt the strength of this authority, has shown little of his
usual ardour and acuteness in repelling it. It was observed, however, by
Madox, that the petition of St. Albans contains two very singular
allegations: it asserts that the town was part of the king's demesne,
whereas it had invariably belonged to the adjoining abbey; and that its
burgesses held by the tenure of attending parliament, instead of all other
services, contrary to all analogy, and without parallel in the condition
of any tenant in capite throughout the kingdom. "It is no wonder,
therefore," says Hume, "that a petition which advances two falsehoods
should contain one historical mistake, which indeed amounts only to an
inaccurate expression." But it must be confessed that we cannot so easily
set aside the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
whole authority of this record. For whatever assurance the
people of St. Albans might show in asserting what was untrue, the king's
council must have been aware how recently the deputies of any towns had
been admitted into parliament. If the lawful birth of the House of Commons
were in 1295, as is maintained by Brady and his disciples, is it
conceivable that, in 1315, the council would have received a petition,
claiming the elective franchise by prescription, and have referred to the
rolls of chancery to inquire whether this had been used in the days of the
king's progenitors? I confess that I see no answer which can easily be
given to this objection by such as adopt the <i>latest</i> epoch of borough
representation, namely, the parliament of 23 E. I. But they are by no
means equally conclusive against the supposition that the communities of
cities and towns, having been first introduced into the legislature during
Leicester's usurpation, in the forty-ninth year of Henry III., were
summoned, not perhaps uniformly, but without any long intermission, to
succeeding parliaments. There is a strong presumption, from the language
of a contemporary historian, that they sat in the parliament of 1269, four
years after that convened by
Leicester.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
It is more unequivocally
stated by another annalist that they were present in the first parliament
of Edward I. held in
1271.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
Nor does a similar inference want some
degree of support from the preambles of the statute of Marlebridge in 51
H. III., of Westminster I. in the third, and of Gloucester in the sixth,
year of Edward I.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
And the writs are extant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
which summon every city,
borough, and market town to send two deputies to a council in the eleventh
year of his reign. I call this a council, for it undoubtedly was not a
parliament. The sheriffs were directed to summon personally all who held
more than twenty pounds a year of the crown, as well as four knights for
each county invested with full powers to act for the commons thereof. The
knights and burgesses thus chosen, as well as the clergy within the
province of Canterbury, met at Northampton; those within the province of
York, at that city. And neither assembly was opened by the
king.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> This
anomalous convention was nevertheless one means of establishing the
representative system, and, to an inquirer free from technical prejudice,
is little less important than a regular parliament. Nor have we long to
look even for this. In the same year, about eight months after the
councils at Northampton and York, writs were issued summoning to a
parliament at Shrewsbury two citizens from London, and as many from each
of twenty other considerable
towns.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
It is a slight cavil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> to object
that these were not directed as usual to the sheriff of each county, but
to the magistrates of each place. Though a very imperfect, this was a
regular and unequivocal representation of the commons in parliament. But
their attendance seems to have intermitted from this time to the
twenty-third year of Edward's
reign.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Barnstaple.</div>

<p>Those to whom the petition of St. Albans is not satisfactory will hardly
yield their conviction to that of Barnstaple. This town set forth in the
eighteenth of Edward III. that, among other franchises granted to them by
a charter of Athelstan, they had ever since exercised the right of sending
two burgesses to parliament. The said charter, indeed, was unfortunately
mislaid; and the prayer of their petition was to obtain one of the like
import in its stead. Barnstaple, it must be observed, was a town belonging
to Lord Audley, and had actually returned members ever since the
twenty-third of Edward I. Upon an inquisition directed by the king to be
made into the truth of these allegations, it was found that "the burgesses
of the said town were wont to send two burgesses to parliament for the
commonalty of the borough;" but nothing appeared as to the pretended
charter of Athelstan, or the liberties which it was alleged to contain.
The burgesses, dissatisfied with this inquest, prevailed that another
should be taken, which certainly answered better their wishes. The second
jury found that Barnstaple was a free borough from time immemorial; that
the burgesses had enjoyed under a charter of Athelstan, which had been
casually lost, certain franchises by them enumerated, and particularly
that they should send two burgesses to parliament; and that it would not
be to the king's prejudice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
if he should grant them a fresh charter in
terms equally ample with that of his predecessor Athelstan. But the
following year we have another writ and another inquest; the former
reciting that the second return had been unduly and fraudulently made; and
the latter expressly contradicting the previous inquest in many points,
and especially finding no proof of Athelstan's supposed charter. Comparing
the various parts of this business, we shall probably be induced to agree
with Willis, that it was but an attempt of the inhabitants of Barnstaple
to withdraw themselves from the jurisdiction of their lord. For the right
of returning burgesses, though it is the main point of our inquiries, was
by no means the most prominent part of their petition, which rather went
to establish some civil privileges of devising their tenements and
electing their own mayor. The first and fairest return finds only that
they were accustomed to send members to parliament, which an usage of
fifty years (from 23 E. I. to 18 E. III.) was fully sufficient to
establish, without searching into more remote
antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>It has, however, probably occurred to the reader of these two cases, St.
Albans and Barnstaple, that the representation of the commons in
parliament was not treated as a novelty, even in times little posterior to
those in which we have been supposing it to have originated. In this
consists, I think, the sole strength of the opposite argument. An act in
the fifth year of Richard II. declares that, if any sheriff shall leave
out of his returns any cities or boroughs which be bound and of old times
were wont to come to the parliament, he shall be punished as was
accustomed to be done in the like case in time
past.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> In the memorable
assertion of legislative right by the commons in the second of Henry V.
(which will be quoted hereafter) they affirm that "the commune of the land
is, <i>and ever has been</i>, a member of
parliament."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> And the consenting
suffrage of our older law-books must be placed in the same scale. The
first gainsayers, I think, were Camden and Sir Henry Spelman, who, upon
probing the antiquities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
our constitution somewhat more exactly than
their predecessors, declared that they could find no signs of the commons
in parliament till the forty-ninth of Henry III. Prynne, some years
afterwards, with much vigour and learning, maintained the same argument,
and Brady completed the victory. But the current doctrine of Westminster
Hall, and still more of the two chambers of parliament, was certainly much
against these antiquaries; and it passed at one time for a surrender of
popular principles, and almost a breach of privilege, to dispute the
lineal descent of the House of Commons from the
witenagemot.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<p>The true ground of these pretensions to antiquity was a very well-founded
persuasion that no other argument would be so conclusive to ordinary
minds, or cut short so effectually all encroachments of the prerogative.
The populace of every country, but none so much as the English, easily
grasp the notion of right, meaning thereby something positive and
definite; while the maxims of expediency or theoretical reasoning pass
slightly over their minds. Happy indeed for England that it is so! But we
have here to do with the fact alone. And it may be observed that several
pious frauds were practised to exalt the antiquity of our constitutional
liberties. These began, perhaps, very early, when the imaginary laws of
Edward the Confessor were so earnestly demanded. They were carried further
under Edward I. and his successor, when the fable of privileges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> granted
by the Conqueror to the men of Kent was devised; when Andrew Horn filled
his Mirrour of Justices with fictitious tales of Alfred; and, above all,
when the "Method of holding parliaments in the time of Ethelred" was
fabricated, about the end of Richard II.'s reign; an imposture which was
not too gross to deceive Sir Edward
Coke.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of summoning deputies from boroughs.</div>

<p>There is no great difficulty in answering the question why the deputies of
boroughs were finally and permanently ingrafted upon parliament by Edward
I.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
The government was becoming constantly more attentive to the wealth
that commerce brought into the kingdom, and the towns were becoming more
flourishing and more independent. But chiefly there was a much stronger
spirit of general liberty and a greater discontent at violent acts of
prerogative from the era of Magna Charta; after which authentic
recognition of free principles many acts which had seemed before but the
regular exercise of authority were looked upon as infringements of the
subject's right. Among these the custom of setting tallages at discretion
would naturally appear the most intolerable; and men were unwilling to
remember that the burgesses who paid them were indebted for the rest of
their possessions to the bounty of the crown. In Edward I.'s reign, even
before the great act of Confirmation of the Charters had rendered
arbitrary impositions absolutely unconstitutional, they might perhaps
excite louder murmurs than a discreet administration would risk. Though
the necessities of the king, therefore, and his imperious temper often led
him to this course,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
it was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
more prudent counsel to try the
willingness of his people before he forced their reluctance. And the
success of his innovation rendered it worth repetition. Whether it were
from the complacency of the commons at being thus admitted among the peers
of the realm, or from a persuasion that the king would take their money if
they refused it, or from inability to withstand the plausible reasons of
his ministers, or from the private influence to which the leaders of every
popular assembly have been accessible, much more was granted in subsidies
after the representation of the towns commenced than had ever been
extorted in tallages.</p>

<p>To grant money was, therefore, the main object of their meeting; and if
the exigencies of the administration could have been relieved without
subsidies, the citizens and burgesses might still have sat at home and
obeyed the laws which a council of prelates and barons enacted for their
government. But it is a difficult question whether the king and the peers
designed to make room for them, as it were, in legislation; and whether
the power of the purse drew after it immediately, of only by degrees,
those indispensable rights of consenting to laws which they now possess.
There are no sufficient means of solving this doubt during the reign of
Edward I. The writ in 22 E. I. directs two knights to be chosen cum plen√¢
potestate pro se et tot√¢ communitate comitat√ªs pr√¶dicti ad consulendum et
consentiendum pro se et communitate ill√¢, his qu√¶ comites, barones, et
proceres pr√¶dicti concorditer ordinaverint in pr√¶missis. That of the next
year runs, ad faciendum tunc quod de communi consilio ordinabitur in
pr√¶missis. The same words are inserted in the writ of 26 E. I. In that of
28 E. I. the knights are directed to be sent cum plen√¢ potestate audiendi
et faciendi qu√¶ ibidem ordinari contigerint pro communi commodo. Several
others of the same reign have the words ad faciendum. The difficulty is to
pronounce whether this term is to be interpreted in the sense of
<i>performing</i> or of <i>enacting</i>; whether the representatives of the commons
were merely to learn from the lords what was to be done, or to bear their
part in advising upon it. The earliest writ, that of 22 E. I., certainly
implies the latter; and I do not know that any of the rest are conclusive
to the contrary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
In the reign of Edward II. the words ad consentiendum
alone, or ad faciendum et consentiendum, begin; and from that of Edward
III. this form has been constantly
used.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
It must still, however, be
highly questionable whether the commons, who had so recently taken their
place in parliament, gave anything more than a constructive assent to the
laws enacted during this reign. They are not even named in the preamble of
any statute till the last year of Edward I. Upon more than one occasion
the sheriffs were directed to return the same members who had sat in the
last parliament, unless prevented by death or
infirmity.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">At what time parliament was divided into two houses.</div>

<p>It has been a very prevailing opinion that parliament was not divided into
two houses at the first admission of the commons. If by this is only meant
that the commons did not occupy a separate chamber till some time in the
reign of Edward III., the proposition, true or false, will be of little
importance. They may have sat at the bottom of Westminster Hall, while the
lords occupied the upper end. But that they were ever intermingled in
voting appears inconsistent with likelihood and authority. The usual
object of calling a parliament was to impose taxes; and these for many
years after the introduction of the commons were laid in different
proportions upon the three estates of the realm. Thus in the 23 E. I. the
earls, barons, and knights gave the king an eleventh, the clergy a tenth;
while he obtained a seventh from the citizens and burgesses; in the
twenty-fourth of the same king the two former of these orders gave a
twelfth, the last an eighth; in the thirty-third year a thirtieth was the
grant of the barons and knights and of the clergy, a twentieth of the
cities and towns; in the first of Edward II. the counties paid a
twentieth, the towns a fifteenth; in the sixth of Edward III. the rates
were a fifteenth and a
tenth.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
These distinct grants imply distinct
grantors; for it is not to be imagined that the commons intermeddled in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
those affecting the lords, or the lords in those of the commons. In fact,
however, there is abundant proof of their separate existence long before
the seventeenth of Edward III., which is the epoch assigned by
Carte,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
or even the sixth of that king, which has been chosen by some other
writers. Thus the commons sat at Acton Burnell in the eleventh of Edward
I., while the upper house was at Shrewsbury. In the eighth of Edward II.
"the commons of England complain to the king and his council,
&amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
These must surely have been the commons assembled in parliament, for who
else could thus have entitled themselves? In the nineteenth of the same
king we find several petitions, evidently proceeding from the body of the
commons in parliament, and complaining of public
grievances.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> The roll
of 1 E. III., though mutilated, is conclusive to show that separate
petitions were then presented by the commons, according to the regular
usage of subsequent
times.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
And indeed the preamble of 1 E. III., stat.
2, is apparently capable of no other inference.</p>

<p>As the knights of shires correspond to the lower nobility of other feudal
countries, we have less cause to be surprised that they belonged
originally to the same branch of parliament as the barons, than at their
subsequent intermixture with men so inferior in station as the citizens
and burgesses. It is by no means easy to define the point of time when
this distribution was settled; but I think it may be inferred from the
rolls of parliament that the houses were divided as they are at present in
the eighth, ninth, and nineteenth years of Edward
II.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> This appears,
however, beyond doubt in the first of Edward
III.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
Yet in the sixth of
the same prince, though the knights and burgesses are expressly mentioned
to have consulted together, the former taxed themselves in a smaller rate
of subsidy than the
latter.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>The proper business of the House of Commons was to petition for redress of
grievances, as much as to provide for the necessities of the crown. In the
prudent fiction of English law no wrong is supposed to proceed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> the
source of right. The throne is fixed upon a pinnacle, which perpetual
beams of truth and justice irradiate, though corruption and partiality may
occupy the middle region and cast their chill shade upon all below. In his
high court of parliament a king of England was to learn where injustice
had been unpunished and where right had been delayed. The common courts of
law, if they were sufficiently honest, were not sufficiently strong, to
redress the subject's injuries where the officers of the crown or the
nobles interfered. To parliament he looked as the great remedial court for
relief of private as well as public grievances. For this cause it was
ordained in the fifth of Edward II. that the king should hold a parliament
once, or if necessary, twice every year; "that the pleas which have been
thus delayed, and those where the justices have differed, may be brought
to a close."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
And a short act of 4 Edward III., which was not very
strictly regarded, provides that a parliament shall be held "every year,
or oftener, if need
be."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
By what persons, and under what limitations,
this jurisdiction in parliament was exercised will come under our future
consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward II. Petitions of parliament during his reign.</div>

<p>The efficacy of a king's personal character in so imperfect a state of
government was never more strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
exemplified than in the two first
Edwards. The father, a little before his death, had humbled his boldest
opponents among the nobility; and as for the commons, so far from claiming
a right of remonstrating, we have seen cause to doubt whether they were
accounted effectual members of the legislature for any purposes but
taxation. But in the very second year of the son's reign they granted the
twenty-fifth penny of their goods, "upon this condition, that the king
should take advice and grant redress upon certain articles wherein they
are aggrieved." These were answered at the ensuing parliament, and are
entered with the king's respective promises of redress upon the roll. It
will be worth while to extract part of this record, that we may see what
were the complaints of the commons of England, and their notions of right,
in 1309. I have chosen on this as on other occasions to translate very
literally, at the expense of some stiffness, and perhaps obscurity, in
language.</p>

<p>"The good people of the kingdom who are come hither to parliament pray our
lord the king that he will, if it please him, have regard to his poor
subjects, who are much aggrieved by reason that they are not governed as
they should be, especially as to the articles of the Great Charter; and
for this, if it please him, they pray remedy. Besides which, they pray
their lord the king to hear what has long aggrieved his people, and still
does so from day to day, on the part of those who call themselves his
officers, and to amend it, if he pleases." The articles, eleven in number,
are to the following purport:&mdash;1. That the king's purveyors seize great
quantities of victuals without payment; 2. That new customs are set on
wine, cloth, and other imports; 3. That the current coin is not so good as
formerly;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
4, 5. That the steward and marshal enlarge their
jurisdiction beyond measure, to the oppression of the people; 6. That the
commons find none to receive petitions addressed to the council; 7. That
the collectors of the king's dues (pernours des prises) in towns and at
fairs take more than is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
lawful; 8. That men are delayed in their civil
suits by writs of protection; 9. That felons escape punishment by
procuring charters of pardon; 10. That the constables of the king's
castles take cognizance of common pleas; 11. That the king's escheators
oust men of lands held by good title, under pretence of an inquest of
office.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<p>These articles display in a short compass the nature of those grievances
which existed under almost all the princes of the Plantagenet dynasty, and
are spread over the rolls of parliament for more than a century after this
time. Edward gave the amplest assurances of putting an end to them all,
except in one instance, the augmented customs on imports, to which he
answered, rather evasively, that he would take them off till he should
perceive whether himself and his people derived advantage from so doing,
and act thereupon as he should be advised. Accordingly, the next year, he
issued writs to collect these new customs again. But the Lords Ordainers
superseded the writs, having entirely abrogated all illegal
impositions.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
It does not appear, however, that, regard had to the
times, there was anything very tyrannical in Edward's government. He set
tallages sometimes, like his father, on his demesne towns, without assent
of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
In the nineteenth year of his reign the commons show
that, "whereas we and our ancestors have given many tallages to the king's
ancestors to obtain the charter of the forest, which charter we have had
confirmed by the present king, paying him largely on our part; yet the
king's officers of the forest seize on lands, and destroy ditches, and
oppress the people, for which they pray remedy, for the sake of God and
his father's soul." They complain at the same time of arbitrary
imprisonment, against the law of the
land.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
To both these petitions the
king returned a promise of redress; and they complete the catalogue of
customary grievances in this period of our constitution.</p>

<p>During the reign of Edward II. the rolls of parliament are imperfect, and
we have not much assistance from other sources. The assent of the commons,
which frequently is not specified in the statutes of this
age,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
appears in a remarkable and revolutionary proceeding, the appointment of
the Lords Ordainers in
1312.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
In this case it indicates that the
aristocratic party then combined against the crown were desirous of
conciliating popularity. An historian relates that some of the commons
were consulted upon the ordinances to be made for the reformation of
government.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward III. The commons establish several rights.</div>

<p>During the long and prosperous reign of Edward III. the efforts of
parliament in behalf of their country were rewarded with success in
establishing upon a firm footing three essential principles of our
government&mdash;the illegality of raising money without consent; the necessity
that the two houses should concur for any alterations in the law; and,
lastly, the right of the commons to inquire into public abuses, and to
impeach public counsellors. By exhibiting proofs of each of these from
parliamentary records I shall be able to substantiate the progressive
improvement of our free constitution, which was principally consolidated
during the reigns of Edward III. and his two next successors. Brady,
indeed, Carte, and the authors of the Parliamentary History, have trod
already over this ground; but none of the three can be considered as
familiar to the generality of readers, and I may at least take credit for
a sincerer love of liberty than any of their writings display.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remonstrances against levying money without consent.</div>

<p>In the sixth year of Edward III. a parliament was called to provide for
the emergency of an Irish rebellion, wherein, "because the king could not
send troops and money to Ireland without the aid of his people, the
prelates, earls, barons, and other great men, and the knights of shires,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and all the commons, of their free will, for the said purpose, and also in
order that the king might live of his own, and not vex his people by
excessive prises, nor in other manner, grant to him the fifteenth penny,
to levy of the
commons,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
and the tenth from the cities, towns, and
royal demesnes. And the king, at the request of the same, in ease of his
people, grants that the commissions lately made to certain persons
assigned to set tallages on cities, towns, and demesnes throughout England
shall be immediately repealed; and that in time to come he will not set
such tallage, except as it has been done in the time of his ancestors, and
as he may reasonably do."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[o]</a></p>

<p>These concluding words are of dangerous implication; and certainly it was
not the intention of Edward, inferior to none of his predecessors in the
love of power, to divest himself of that eminent prerogative, which,
however illegally since the Confirmatio Chartarum, had been exercised by
them all. But the parliament took no notice of this reservation, and
continued with unshaken perseverance to insist on this incontestable and
fundamental right, which he was prone enough to violate.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth year of this reign the lords gave their answer to
commissioners sent to open the parliament, and to treat with them on the
king's part, in a sealed roll. This contained a grant of the tenth sheaf,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
fleece, and lamb. But before they gave it they took care to have letters
patent showed them, by which the commissioners had power "to grant some
graces to the great and small of the kingdom." "And the said lords," the
roll proceeds to say, "will that the imposition (maletoste) which now
again has been levied upon wool be entirely abolished, that the old
customary duty be kept, and that they may have it by charter, and by
enrolment in parliament, that such custom be never more levied, and that
this grant now made to the king, or any other made in time past, shall not
turn hereafter to their charge, nor be drawn into precedent." The commons,
who gave their answer in a separate roll, declared that they could grant
no subsidy without consulting their constituents; and therefore begged
that another parliament might be summoned, and in the mean time they would
endeavour, by using persuasion with the people of their respective
counties, to procure the grant of a reasonable aid in the next
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
They demanded also that the imposition on wool and lead
should be taken as it used to be in former times, "inasmuch as it is
enhanced without assent of the commons, or of the lords, as we understand;
and if it be otherwise demanded, that any one of the commons may refuse it
(le puisse arester), without being troubled on that account (saunz estre
chalang√©.)"<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<p>Wool, however, the staple export of that age, was too easy and tempting a
prey to be relinquished by a prince engaged in an impoverishing war. Seven
years afterwards, in 20 E. III., we find the commons praying that the
great subsidy of forty shillings upon the sack of wool be taken off; and
the old custom paid as heretofore was assented to and granted. The
government spoke this time in a more authoritative tone. "As to this
point," the answer runs, "the prelates and others, seeing in what need the
king stood of an aid before his passage beyond sea, to recover his rights
and defend his kingdom of England, consented, with the concurrence of the
merchants, that he should have in aid of his said war, and in defence of
his said kingdom, forty shillings of subsidy for each sack of wool that
should be exported beyond sea for two years to come. And upon this grant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
divers merchants have made many advances to our lord the king in aid of
his war; for which cause this subsidy cannot be repealed without assent of
the king and his lords."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that Edward's counsellors wished to establish a
distinction, long afterwards revived by those of James I., between customs
levied on merchandise at the ports and internal taxes. The statute
entitled Confirmatio Chartarum had manifestly taken away the prerogative
of imposing the latter, which, indeed, had never extended beyond the
tenants of the royal demesne. But its language was not quite so explicit
as to the former, although no reasonable doubt could be entertained that
the intention of the legislature was to abrogate every species of
imposition unauthorized by parliament. The thirtieth section of Magna
Charta had provided that foreign merchants should be free from all
tributes, except the ancient customs; and it was strange to suppose that
natives were excluded from the benefit of that enactment. Yet, owing to
the ambiguous and elliptical style so frequent in our older laws, this was
open to dispute, and could, perhaps, only be explained by usage. Edward
I., in despite of both these statutes, had set a duty of threepence in the
pound upon goods imported by merchant strangers. This imposition was
noticed as a grievance in the third year of his successor, and repealed by
the Lords Ordainers. It was revived, however, by Edward III., and
continued to be levied ever
afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[s]</a></p>

<p>Edward was led by the necessities of his unjust and expensive war into
another arbitrary encroachment, of which we find as many complaints as of
his pecuniary extortions. The commons pray, in the same parliament of 20
E. III., that commissions should not issue for the future out of chancery
to charge the people with providing men-at-arms, hobelers (or light
cavalry), archers, victuals, or in any other manner, without consent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of parliament. It is replied to this petition, that "it is notorious how in
many parliaments the lords and commons had promised to aid the king in his
quarrel with their bodies and goods as far as was in their power;
wherefore the said lords, seeing the necessity in which the king stood of
having aid of men-at-arms, hobelers, and archers, before his passage to
recover his rights beyond sea, and to defend his realm of England,
ordained that such as had five pounds a year, or more, in land on this
side of Trent should furnish men-at-arms, hobelers, and archers, according
to the proportion of the land they held, to attend the king at his cost;
and some who would neither go themselves nor find others in their stead
were willing to give the king wherewithal he might provide himself with
some in their place. And thus the thing has been done, and no otherwise.
And the king wills that henceforth what has been thus done in this
necessity be not drawn into consequence or
example."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p>The commons were not abashed by these arbitrary pretensions; they knew
that by incessant remonstrances they should gain at least one essential
point, that of preventing the crown from claiming these usurpations as
uncontested prerogatives. The roll of parliament in the next two years,
the 21st and 22nd of Edw. III., is full of the same complaints on one
side, and the same allegations of necessity on the
other.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> In the
latter year the commons grant a subsidy, on condition that no illegal
levying of money should take place, with several other remedial
provisions; "and that these conditions should be entered on the roll of
parliament, as a matter of record, by which they may have remedy, if
anything should be attempted to the contrary in time to come." From this
year the complaints of extortion become rather less frequent; and soon
afterwards a statute was passed, "That no man shall be constrained to find
men-at-arms, hobelers, nor archers, other than those which hold by such
services, if it be not by common assent and grant made in
parliament."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
Yet, even in the last year of Edward's reign, when the
boundaries of prerogative and the rights of parliament were better
ascertained, the king lays a sort of claim to impose charges upon his
subjects in cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of great necessity, and for the defence of his
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
But this more humble language indicates a change in the
spirit of government, which, after long fretting impatiently at the curb,
began at length to acknowledge the controlling hand of law.</p>

<p>These are the chief instances of a struggle between the crown and commons
as to arbitrary taxation; but there are two remarkable proceedings in the
45th and 46th of Edward, which, though they would not have been endured in
later times, are rather anomalies arising out of the unsettled state of
the constitution and the recency of parliamentary rights than mere
encroachments of the prerogative. In the former year parliament had
granted a subsidy of fifty thousand pounds, to be collected by an
assessment of twenty-two shillings and threepence upon every parish, on a
presumption that the parishes in England amounted to forty-five thousand,
whereas they were hardly a fifth of that number. This amazing mistake was
not discovered till the parliament had been dissolved. Upon its detection
the king summoned a great council, consisting of one knight, citizen, and
burgess, named by himself out of two that had been returned to the last
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
To this assembly the chancellor set forth the deficiency
of the last subsidy, and proved by the certificates of all the bishops in
England how strangely the parliament had miscalculated the number of
parishes; whereupon they increased the parochial assessment, by their own
authority, to one hundred and sixteen
shillings.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
It is obvious that
the main intention of parliament was carried into effect by this
irregularity, which seems to have been the subject of no complaint. In the
next parliament a still more objectionable measure was resorted to; after
the petitions of the commons had been answered, and the knights dismissed,
the citizens and burgesses were convened before the prince of Wales and
the lords in a room near the white chamber, and solicited to renew their
subsidy of forty shillings upon the tun of wine, and sixpence in the pound
upon other imports, for safe convoy of shipping, during one year more, to
which they assented, "and so
departed."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The concurrence of both houses in legislation necessary.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
The second constitutional principle established in the reign of Edward
III. was that the king and two houses of parliament, in conjunction,
possessed exclusively the right of legislation. Laws were now declared to
be made by the king at the request of the commons, and by the assent of
the lords and prelates. Such at least was the general form, though for
many subsequent ages there was no invariable regularity in this respect.
The commons, who till this reign were rarely mentioned, were now as rarely
omitted in the enacting clause. In fact, it is evident from the rolls of
parliament that statutes were almost always founded upon their
petition.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
These petitions, with the respective answers made to them
in the king's name, were drawn up after the end of the session in the form
of laws, and entered upon the statute-roll. But here it must be remarked
that the petitions were often extremely qualified and altered by the
answer, insomuch that many statutes of this and some later reigns by no
means express the true sense of the commons. Sometimes they contented
themselves with showing their grievance, and praying remedy from the king
and his council. Of this one eminent instance is the great statute of
treasons. In the petition whereon this act is founded it is merely prayed
that, "whereas the king's justices in different counties adjudge persons
indicted before them to be traitors for sundry matters not known by the
commons to be treason, it would please the king by his council, and by the
great and wise men of the land, to declare what are treasons in this
present parliament." The answer to this petition contains the existing
statute, as a declaration on the king's
part.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
But there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> is no
appearance that it received the direct assent of the lower house. In the
next reigns we shall find more remarkable instances of assuming a consent
which was never positively given.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Statutes distinguished from ordinances.</div>

<p>The statute of treasons, however, was supposed to be declaratory of the
ancient law: in permanent and material innovations a more direct
concurrence of all the estates was probably required. A new statute, to be
perpetually incorporated with the law of England, was regarded as no light
matter. It was a very common answer to a petition of the commons, in the
early part of this reign, that it could not be granted without making a
new law. After the parliament of 14 E. III. a certain number of prelates,
barons, and counsellors, with twelve knights and six burgesses, were
appointed to sit from day to day in order to turn such petitions and
answers as were fit to be perpetual into a statute; but for such as were
of a temporary nature the king issued his letters
patent.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> This
reluctance to innovate without necessity, and to swell the number of laws
which all were bound to know and obey with an accumulation of transitory
enactments, led apparently to the distinction between statutes and
ordinances. The latter are indeed defined by some lawyers to be
regulations proceeding from the king and lords without concurrence of the
commons. But if this be applicable to some ordinances, it is certain that
the word, even when opposed to statute, with which it is often synonymous,
sometimes denotes an act of the whole legislature. In the 37th of Edward
III., when divers sumptuary regulations against excess of apparel were
made in full parliament, "it was demanded of the lords and commons,
inasmuch as the matter of their petitions was novel and unheard of before,
whether they would have them granted by way of ordinance or of statute.
They answered that it would be best to have them by way of ordinance and
not of statute, in order that anything which should need amendment might
be amended at the next
parliament."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
So much scruple did they
entertain about tampering with the statute law of the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Ordinances which, if it were not for their partial or temporary
operation, could not well be distinguished from
laws,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> were often
established in great councils. These assemblies, which frequently occurred
in Edward's reign, were hardly distinguishable, except in name, from
parliaments; being constituted not only of those who were regularly
summoned to the house of lords, but of deputies from counties, cities, and
boroughs. Several places that never returned burgesses to parliament have
sent deputies to some of these
councils.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
The most remarkable of these
was that held in the 27th of Edward III., consisting of one knight for
each county, and of two citizens or burgesses from every city or borough
wherein the ordinances of the staple were
established.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
These were
previously agreed upon by the king and lords, and copies given, one to the
knights, another to the burgesses. The roll tells us that they gave their
opinion in writing to the council, after much deliberation, and that this
was read and discussed by the great men. These ordinances fix the staple
of wool in particular places within England, prohibit English merchants
from exporting that article under pain of death, inflict sundry other
penalties, create jurisdictions, and in short have the effect of a new and
important law. After they were passed the deputies of the commons granted
a subsidy for three years, complained of grievances, and received answers,
as if in a regular parliament. But they were aware that these proceedings
partook of some irregularity, and endeavoured, as was their constant
method, to keep up the legal forms of the constitution. In the last
petition of this council the commons pray, "because many articles touching
the state of the king and common profit of his kingdom have been agreed by
him, the prelates, lords, and commons of his land, at this council, that
the said articles may be recited at the next parliament, and entered upon
the roll; for this cause, that ordinances and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
agreements made in council
are not of record, as if they had been made in a general parliament." This
accordingly was done at the ensuing parliament, when these ordinances were
expressly confirmed, and directed to be "holden for a statute to endure
always."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<p>It must be confessed that the distinction between ordinances and statutes
is very obscure, and perhaps no precise and uniform principle can be laid
down about it. But it sufficiently appears that whatever provisions
altered the common law or any former statute, and were entered upon the
statute-roll, transmitted to the sheriffs, and promulgated to the people
as general obligatory enactments, were holden to require the positive
assent of both houses of parliament, duly and formally summoned.</p>

<p>Before we leave this subject it will be proper to take notice of a
remarkable stretch of prerogative, which, if drawn into precedent, would
have effectually subverted this principle of parliamentary consent in
legislation. In the 15th of Edward III. petitions were presented of a
bolder and more innovating cast than was acceptable to the court:&mdash;That no
peer should be put to answer for any trespass except before his peers;
that commissioners should be assigned to examine the accounts of such as
had received public moneys; that the judges and ministers should be sworn
to observe the Great Charter and other laws; and that they should be
appointed in parliament. The last of these was probably the most
obnoxious; but the king, unwilling to defer a supply which was granted
merely upon condition that these petitions should prevail, suffered them
to pass into a statute with an alteration which did not take off much from
their efficacy&mdash;namely, that these officers should indeed be appointed by
the king with the advice of his council, but should surrender their
charges at the next parliament, and be there responsible to any who should
have cause of complaint against them. The chancellor, treasurer, and
judges entered their protestation that they had not assented to the said
statutes, nor could they observe them, in case they should prove contrary
to the laws and customs of the kingdom, which they were sworn to
maintain.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
This is the first instance of a protest on the roll of
parliament against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
passing of an act. Nevertheless they were
compelled to swear on the cross of Canterbury to its
observance.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<p>This excellent statute was attempted too early for complete success.
Edward's ministers plainly saw that it left them at the mercy of future
parliaments, who would readily learn the wholesome and constitutional
principle of sparing the sovereign while they punished his advisers. They
had recourse therefore to a violent measure, but which was likely in those
times to be endured. By a proclamation addressed to all the sheriffs the
king revokes and annuls the statute, as contrary to the laws and customs
of England and to his own just rights and prerogatives, which he had sworn
to preserve; declaring that he had never consented to its passing, but,
having previously protested that he would revoke it, lest the parliament
should have been separated in wrath, had dissembled, as was his duty, and
permitted the great seal to be affixed; and that it appeared to the earls,
barons, and other learned persons of his kingdom with whom he had
consulted, that, as the said statute had not proceeded from his own good
will, it was null, and could not have the name or force of
law.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> This
revocation of a statute, as the price of which a subsidy had been granted,
was a gross infringement of law, and undoubtedly passed for such at that
time; for the right was already clear, though the remedy was not always
attainable. Two years afterwards Edward met his parliament, when that
obnoxious statute was formally
repealed.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Advice of parliament required on matters of war and peace.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the king's unwillingness to permit this control of
parliament over his administration, he suffered, or rather solicited,
their interference in matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
which have since been reckoned the
exclusive province of the crown. This was an unfair trick of his policy.
He was desirous, in order to prevent any murmuring about subsidies, to
throw the war upon parliament as their own act, though none could have
been commenced more selfishly for his own benefit, or less for the
advantage of the people of England. It is called "the war which our lord
the king has undertaken against his adversary of France by common assent
of all the lords and commons of his realm in divers
parliaments."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> And
he several times referred it to them to advise upon the subject of peace.
But the commons showed their humility or discretion by treating this as an
invitation which it would show good manners to decline, though in the
eighteenth of the king's reign they had joined with the lords in imploring
the king to make an end of the war by a battle or by a suitable
peace.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
"Most dreaded lord," they say upon one occasion, "as to your
war, and the equipment necessary for it, we are so ignorant and simple
that we know not how, nor have the power, to devise; wherefore we pray
your grace to excuse us in this matter, and that it please you, with
advice of the great and wise persons of your council, to ordain what seems
best to you for the honour and profit of yourself and your kingdom; and
whatever shall be thus ordained by assent and agreement for you and your
lords we readily assent to, and will hold it firmly
established."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> At
another time, after their petitions had been answered, "it was shewed to
the lords and commons by Bartholomew de Burghersh, the king's chamberlain,
how a treaty had been set on foot between the king and his adversary of
France; and how he had good hope of a final and agreeable issue with God's
help; to which he would not come without assent of the lords and commons.
Wherefore the said chamberlain inquired on the king's part of the said
lords and commons whether they would assent and agree to the peace, in
case it might be had by treaty between the parties. To which the said
commons with one voice replied, that whatever end it should please the
king and lords to make of the treaty would be agreeable to them. On which
answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the chamberlain said to the commons, Then you will assent to a
perpetual treaty of peace if it can be had. And the said commons answered
at once and unanimously, Yes,
yes."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
The lords were not so diffident.
Their great station as hereditary councillors gave them weight in all
deliberations of government; and they seem to have pretended to a negative
voice in the question of peace. At least they answer, upon the proposals
made by David king of Scots in 1368, which were submitted to them in
parliament, that, "saving to the said David and his heirs the articles
contained therein, they saw no way of making a treaty which would not
openly turn to the disherison of the king and his heirs, to which they
would on no account assent; and so departed for that
day."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> A few
years before they had made a similar answer to some other propositions
from Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
It is not improbable that, in both these cases, they
acted with the concurrence and at the instigation of the king; but the
precedents, might have been remembered in other circumstances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Right of the commons to inquire into public abuses.</div>

<p>A third important acquisition of the house of commons during this reign
was the establishment of their right to investigate and chastise the
abuses of administration. In the fourteenth of Edward III. a committee of
the lords' house had been appointed to examine the accounts of persons
responsible for the receipt of the last subsidy; but it does not appear
that the commons were concerned in
this.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
The unfortunate statute of
the next year contained a similar provision, which was annulled with the
rest. Many years elapsed before the commons tried the force of their
vindictive arm. We must pass onward an entire generation of man, and look
at the parliament assembled in the fiftieth of Edward III. Nothing
memorable as to the interference of the commons in government occurs
before, unless it be their request, in the forty-fifth of the king, that
no clergyman should be made chancellor, treasurer, or other great officer;
to which the king answered that he would do what best pleased his
council.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[z]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament of 50 E. III.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
It will be remembered by every one who has read our history that in the
latter years of Edward's life his fame was tarnished by the ascendancy of
the duke of Lancaster and Alice Perrers. The former, a man of more
ambition than his capacity seems to have warranted, even incurred the
suspicion of meditating to set aside the heir of the crown when the Black
Prince should have sunk into the grave. Whether he were wronged or not by
these conjectures, they certainly appear to have operated on those most
concerned to take alarm at them. A parliament met in April, 1376, wherein
the general unpopularity of the king's administration, or the influence of
the prince of Wales, led to very remarkable
consequences.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> After
granting a subsidy, the commons, "considering the evils of the country,
through so many wars and other causes, and that the officers now in the
king's service are insufficient without further assistance for so great a
charge, pray that the council be strengthened by the addition of ten or
twelve bishops, lords, and others, to be constantly at hand, so that no
business of weight should be despatched without the consent of all; nor
smaller matters without that of four or
six."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
The king pretended to
come with alacrity into this measure, which was followed by a strict
restraint on them and all other officers from taking presents in the
course of their duty. After this, "the said commons appeared in
parliament, protesting that they had the same good will as ever to assist
the king with their lives and fortunes; but that it seemed to them, if
their said liege lord had always possessed about him faithful counsellors
and good officers, he would have been so rich that he would have had no
need of charging his commons with subsidy or tallage, considering the
great ransoms of the French and Scotch kings, and of so many other
prisoners; and that it appeared to be for the private advantage of some
near the king, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
others by their collusion, that the king and
kingdom are so impoverished, and the commons so ruined. And they promised
the king that, if he would do speedy justice on such as should be found
guilty, and take from them what law and reason permit, with what had been
already granted in parliament, they will engage that he should be rich
enough to maintain his wars for a long time, without much charging his
people in any manner." They next proceeded to allege three particular
grievances; the removal of the staple from Calais, where it had been fixed
by parliament, through the procurement and advice of the said private
counsellors about the king; the participation of the same persons in
lending money to the king at exorbitant usury; and their purchasing at a
low rate, for their own benefit, old debts from the crown, the whole of
which they had afterwards induced the king to repay to themselves. For
these and for many more misdemeanours the commons accused and impeached
the lords Latimer and Nevil, with four merchants, Lyons, Ellis, Peachey,
and Bury.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
Latimer had been chamberlain, and Nevil held another
office. The former was the friend and creature of the duke of Lancaster.
Nor was this parliament at all nice in touching a point where kings least
endure their interference. An ordinance was made, that, "whereas many
women prosecute the suits of others in courts of justice by way of
maintenance, and to get profit thereby, which is displeasing to the king,
he forbids any woman henceforward, and especially Alice Perrers, to do so,
on pain of the said Alice forfeiting all her goods, and suffering
banishment from the
kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>The part which the prince of Wales, who had ever been distinguished for
his respectful demeanour towards Edward, bore in this unprecedented
opposition, is strong evidence of the jealousy with which he regarded the
duke of Lancaster; and it was led in the house of commons by Peter de la
Mare, a servant of the earl of March, who, by his marriage with Philippa,
heiress of Lionel duke of Clarence, stood next after the young prince
Richard in lineal succession to the crown. The proceedings of this session
were indeed highly popular.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
But no house of commons would have gone such
lengths on the mere support of popular opinion, unless instigated and
encouraged by higher authority. Without this their petitions might perhaps
have obtained, for the sake of subsidy, an immediate consent; but those
who took the lead in preparing them must have remained unsheltered after a
dissolution, to abide the vengeance of the crown, with no assurance that
another parliament would espouse their cause as its own. Such, indeed, was
their fate in the present instance. Soon after the dissolution of
parliament, the prince of Wales, who, long sinking by fatal decay, had
rallied his expiring energies for this domestic combat, left his
inheritance to a child ten years old, Richard of Bordeaux. Immediately
after this event Lancaster recovered his influence; and the former
favourites returned to court. Peter de la Mare was confined at Nottingham,
where he remained two years. The citizens indeed attempted an
insurrection, and threatened to burn the Savoy, Lancaster's residence, if
de la Mare was not released; but the bishop of London succeeded in
appeasing them.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
A parliament met next year which overthrew the work
of its predecessor, restored those who had been impeached, and repealed
the ordinance against Alice
Perrers.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
So little security will popular
assemblies ever afford against arbitrary power, when deprived of regular
leaders and the consciousness of mutual fidelity.</p>

<p>The policy adopted by the prince of Wales and earl of March, in employing
the house of commons as an engine of attack against an obnoxious ministry,
was perfectly novel, and indicates a sensible change in the character of
our constitution. In the reign of Edward II. parliament had little share
in resisting the government; much more was effected by the barons through
risings of their feudal tenantry. Fifty years of authority better
respected, of law better enforced, had rendered these more perilous, and
of a more violent appearance than formerly. A surer resource presented
itself in the increased weight of the lower house in parliament. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> this
indirect aristocratical influence gave a surprising impulse to that
assembly, and particularly tended to establish beyond question its control
over public abuses. It is no less just to remark that it also tended to
preserve the relation and harmony between each part and the other, and to
prevent that jarring of emulation and jealousy which, though generally
found in the division of power between a noble and a popular estate, has
scarcely ever caused a dissension, except in cases of little moment,
between our two houses of parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard II. Great increase of the power of the commons.</div>

<p>The commons had sustained with equal firmness and discretion a defensive
war against arbitrary power under Edward III.: they advanced with very
different steps towards his successor. Upon the king's death, though
Richard's coronation took place without delay, and no proper regency was
constituted, yet a council of twelve, whom the great officers of state
were to obey, supplied its place to every effectual intent. Among these
the duke of Lancaster was not numbered; and he retired from court in some
disgust. In the first parliament of the young king a large proportion of
the knights who had sat in that which impeached the Lancastrian party were
returned.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
Peter de la Mare, now released from prison, was elected
speaker; a dignity which, according to some, he had filled in the Good
Parliament, as that of the fiftieth of Edward III. was popularly styled;
though the rolls do not mention either him or any other as bearing that
honourable name before Sir Thomas Hungerford in the parliament of the
following year.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
The prosecution against Alice Perrers was now
revived; not, as far as appears, by direct impeachment of the commons; but
articles were exhibited against her in the house of lords on the king's
part, for breaking the ordinance made against her intermeddling at court:
upon which she received judgment of banishment and
forfeiture.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> At the
request of the lower house, the lords, in the king's name, appointed nine
persons of different ranks&mdash;three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
bishops, two earls, two bannerets, and
two bachelors&mdash;to be a permanent council about the king, so that no
business of importance should be transacted without their unanimous
consent. The king was even compelled to consent that, during his minority,
the chancellor, treasurer, judges, and other chief officers, should be
made in parliament; by which provision, combined with that of the
parliamentary council, the whole executive government was transferred to
the two houses. A petition that none might be employed in the king's
service, nor belong to his council, who had been formerly accused upon
good grounds, struck at lord Latimer, who had retained some degree of
power in the new establishment. Another, suggesting that Gascony, Ireland,
Artois, and the Scottish marches were in danger of being lost for want of
good officers, though it was so generally worded as to leave the means of
remedy to the king's pleasure, yet shows a growing energy and
self-confidence in that assembly which not many years before had thought
the question of peace or war too high for their deliberation. Their
subsidy was sufficiently liberal; but they took care to pray the king that
fit persons might be assigned for its receipt and disbursement, lest it
should any way be diverted from the purposes of the war. Accordingly
Walworth and Philpot, two eminent citizens of London, were appointed to
this office, and sworn in parliament to its
execution.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<p>But whether through the wastefulness of government, or rather because
Edward's legacy, the French war, like a ruinous and interminable lawsuit,
exhausted all public contributions, there was an equally craving demand
for subsidy at the next meeting of parliament. The commons now made a more
serious stand. The speaker, Sir James Pickering, after the protestation
against giving offence which has since become more matter of form than,
perhaps, it was then considered, reminded the lords of the council of a
promise made to the last parliament, that, if they would help the king for
once with a large subsidy, so as to enable him to undertake an expedition
against the enemy, he trusted not to call on them again, but to support
the war from his own revenues; in faith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of which promise there had been
granted the largest sum that any king of England had ever been suffered to
levy within so short a time, to the utmost loss and inconvenience of the
commons, part of which ought still to remain in the treasury, and render
it unnecessary to burthen anew the exhausted people. To this Scrope, lord
steward of the household, protesting that he knew not of any such promise,
made answer by order of the king, that, "saving the honour and reverence
of our lord the king, and the lords there present, the commons did not
speak truth in asserting that part of the last subsidy should be still in
the treasury; it being notorious that every penny had gone into the hands
of Walworth and Philpot, appointed and sworn treasurers in the last
parliament, to receive and expend it upon the purposes of the war, for
which they had in effect disbursed the whole." Not satisfied with this
general justification, the commons pressed for an account of the
expenditure. Scrope was again commissioned to answer, that, "though it had
never been seen that of a subsidy or other grant made to the king in
parliament or out of parliament by the commons any account had afterwards
been rendered to the commons, or to any other except the king and his
officers, yet the king, to gratify them, of his own accord, without doing
it by way of right, would have Walworth along with certain persons of the
council exhibit to them in writing a clear account of the receipt and
expenditure, upon condition that this should never be used as a precedent,
nor inferred to be done otherwise than by the king's spontaneous command."
The commons were again urged to provide for the public defence, being
their own concern as much as that of the king. But they merely shifted
their ground and had recourse to other pretences. They requested that five
or six peers might come to them, in order to discuss this question of
subsidy. The lords entirely rejected this proposal, and affirmed that such
a proceeding had never been known except in the three last parliaments;
but allowed that it had been the course to elect a committee of eight or
ten from each house, to confer easily and without noise together. The
commons acceded to this, and a committee of conference was appointed,
though no result of their discussion appears upon the roll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Upon examining the accounts submitted to them, these sturdy commoners
raised a new objection. It appeared that large sums had been expended upon
garrisons in France and Ireland and other places beyond the kingdom, of
which they protested themselves not liable to bear the charge. It was
answered that Gascony and the king's other dominions beyond sea were the
outworks of England, nor could the people ever be secure from war at their
thresholds, unless these were maintained. They lastly insisted that the
king ought to be rich through the wealth that had devolved on him from his
grandfather. But this was affirmed, in reply, to be merely sufficient for
the payment of Edward's creditors. Thus driven from all their arguments,
the commons finally consented to a moderate additional imposition upon the
export of wool and leather, which were already subject to considerable
duties, apologizing on account of their poverty for the slenderness of
their grant.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<p>The necessities of government, however, let their cause be what it might,
were by no means feigned; and a new parliament was assembled about seven
months after the last, wherein the king, without waiting for a petition,
informed the commons that the treasurers were ready to exhibit their
accounts before them. This was a signal victory after the reluctant and
ungracious concession made to the last parliament. Nine persons of
different ranks were appointed at the request of the commons to
investigate the state of the revenue and the disposition which had been
made of the late king's personal estate. They ended by granting a
poll-tax, which they pretended to think adequate to the supply
required.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
But in those times no one possessed any statistical
knowledge, and every calculation which required it was subject to enormous
error, of which we have already seen an eminent
example.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> In the next
parliament (3 Ric. II.) it was set forth that only 22,000<i>l.</i> had been
collected by the poll-tax, while the pay of the king's troops hired for
the expedition to Britany, the pretext of the grant, had amounted for but
half a year to 50,000<i>l.</i> The king, in short, was more straitened than
ever. His distresses gave no small advantage to the commons. Their speaker
was instructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to declare that, as it appeared to them, if the affairs of
their liege lord had been properly conducted at home and abroad, he could
not have wanted aid of his commons, who now are poorer than before. They
pray that, as the king was so much advanced in age and discretion, his
perpetual council (appointed in his first parliament) might be discharged
of their labours, and that, instead of them, the five chief officers of
state, to wit, the chancellor, treasurer, keeper of the privy seal,
chamberlain, and steward of the household, might be named in parliament,
and declared to the commons, as the king's sole counsellors, not removable
before the next parliament. They required also a general commission to be
made out, similar to that in the last session, giving powers to a certain
number of peers and other distinguished persons to inquire into the state
of the household, as well as into all receipts and expenses since the
king's accession. The former petition seems to have been passed
over;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
but a commission as requested was made out to three prelates, three earls,
three bannerets, three knights, and three
citizens.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> After guarding
thus, as they conceived, against malversation, but in effect rather
protecting their posterity than themselves, the commons prolonged the last
imposition on wool and leather for another year.</p>

<p>It would be but repetition to make extracts from the rolls of the two next
years; we have still the same tale&mdash;demand of subsidy on one side,
remonstrance and endeavours at reformation on the other. After the
tremendous insurrection of the villeins in 1382 a parliament was convened
to advise about repealing the charters of general manumission, extorted
from the king by the pressure of circumstances. In this measure all
concurred; but the commons were not afraid to say that the late risings
had been provoked by the burthens which a prodigal court had called for in
the preceding session. Their language is unusually bold. "It seemed to
them, after full deliberation," they said, "that, unless the
administration of the kingdom were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
speedily reformed, the kingdom itself
would be utterly lost and ruined for ever, and therein their lord the
king, with all the peers and commons, which God forbid. For true it is
that there are such defects in the said administration, as well about the
king's person and his household as in his courts of justice; and by
grievous oppressions in the country through maintainers of suits, who are,
as it were, kings in the country, that right and law are come to nothing,
and the poor commons are from time to time so pillaged and ruined; partly
by the king's purveyors of the household, and others who pay nothing for
what they take, partly by the subsidies and tallages raised upon them, and
besides by the oppressive behaviour of the servants of the king and other
lords, and especially of the aforesaid maintainers of suits, that they are
reduced to greater poverty and discomfort than ever they were before. And
moreover, though great sums have been continually granted by and levied
upon them, for the defence of the kingdom, yet they are not the better
defended against their enemies, but every year are plundered and wasted by
sea and land, without any relief. Which calamities the said poor commons,
who lately used to live in honour and prosperity, can no longer endure.
And to speak the real truth, these injuries lately done to the poorer
commons, more than they ever suffered before, caused them to rise and to
commit the mischief done in their late riot; and there is still cause to
fear greater evils, if sufficient remedy be not timely provided against
the outrages and oppressions aforesaid. Wherefore may it please our lord
the king, and the noble peers of the realm now assembled in this
parliament, to provide such remedy and amendment as to the said
administration, that the state and dignity of the king in the first place,
and of the lords, may be preserved, as the commons have always desired,
and the commons may be put in peace; removing, as soon as they can be
detected, evil ministers and counsellors, and putting in their stead the
best and most sufficient, and taking away all the bad practices which have
led to the last rising, or else none can imagine that this kingdom can
longer subsist without greater misfortunes than it ever endured. And for
God's sake let it not be forgotten that there be put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> about the king, and
of his council, the best lords and knights that can be found in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>"And be it known (the entry proceeds) that, after the king our lord with
the peers of the realm and his council had taken advice upon these
requests made to him for his good and his kingdom's as it really appeared
to him, willed and granted that certain bishops, lords, and others should
be appointed to survey and examine in privy council both the government of
the king's person and of his household, and to suggest proper remedies
wherever necessary, and report them to the king. And it was said by the
peers in parliament, that, as it seemed to them, if reform of government
were to take place throughout the kingdom, it should begin by the chief
member, which is the king himself, and so from person to person, as well
churchmen as others, and place to place, from higher to lower, without
sparing any degree."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
A considerable number of commissioners were
accordingly appointed, whether by the king alone, or in parliament, does
not appear; the latter, however, is more probable. They seem to have made
some progress in the work of reformation, for we find that the officers of
the household were sworn to observe their regulations. But in all
likelihood these were soon neglected.</p>

<p>It is not wonderful that, with such feelings of resentment towards the
crown, the commons were backward in granting subsidies. Perhaps the king
would not have obtained one at all if he had not withheld his charter of
pardon for all offences committed during the insurrection. This was
absolutely necessary to restore quiet among the people; and though the
members of the commons had certainly not been insurgents, yet inevitable
irregularities had occurred in quelling the tumults, which would have put
them too much in the power of those unworthy men who filled the benches of
justice under Richard. The king declared that it was unusual to grant a
pardon without a subsidy; the commons still answered that they would
consider about that matter; and the king instantly rejoined that he would
consider about his pardon (s'aviseroit de sa dite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> grace) till they had
done what they ought. They renewed, at length the usual tax on wool and
leather.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[s]</a></p>

<p>This extraordinary assumption of power by the commons was not merely owing
to the king's poverty. It was encouraged by the natural feebleness of a
disunited government. The high rank and ambitious spirit of Lancaster gave
him no little influence, though contending with many enemies at court as
well as the ill-will of the people. Thomas of Woodstock, the king's
youngest uncle, more able and turbulent than Lancaster, became, as he grew
older, an eager competitor for power, which he sought through the channel
of popularity. The earls of March, Arundel, and Warwick bore a
considerable part, and were the favourites of parliament. Even Lancaster,
after a few years, seems to have fallen into popular courses, and
recovered some share of public esteem. He was at the head of the reforming
commission in the fifth of Richard II., though he had been studiously
excluded from those preceding. We cannot hope to disentangle the intrigues
of this remote age, as to which our records are of no service, and the
chroniclers are very slightly informed. So far as we may conjecture,
Lancaster, finding his station insecure at court, began to solicit the
favour of the commons, whose hatred of the administration abated their
former hostility towards him.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of Richard.</div>

<p>The character of Richard II. was now developing itself, and the hopes
excited by his remarkable presence of mind in confronting the rioters on
Blackheath were rapidly destroyed. Not that he was wanting in capacity, as
has been sometimes imagined. For if we measure intellectual power by the
greatest exertion it ever displays, rather than by its average results,
Richard II. was a man of considerable talents. He possessed, along with
much dissimulation, a decisive promptitude in seizing the critical moment
for action. Of this quality, besides his celebrated behaviour towards the
insurgents, he gave striking evidence in several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
circumstances which we
shall have shortly to notice. But his ordinary conduct belied the
abilities which on these rare occasions shone forth, and rendered them
ineffectual for his security. Extreme pride and violence, with an
inordinate partiality for the most worthless favourites, were his
predominant characteristics. In the latter quality, and in the events of
his reign, he forms a pretty exact parallel to Edward II. Scrope, lord
chancellor, who had been appointed in parliament, and was understood to be
irremovable without its concurrence, lost the great seal for refusing to
set it to some prodigal grants. Upon a slight quarrel with archbishop
Courtney the king ordered his temporalities to be seized, the execution of
which, Michael de la Pole, his new chancellor, and a favourite of his own,
could hardly prevent. This was accompanied with indecent and outrageous
expressions of anger, unworthy of his station and of those whom he
insulted.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He acquires more power on his majority.</div>

<p>Though no king could be less respectable than Richard, yet the
constitution invested a sovereign with such ample prerogative, that it was
far less easy to resist his personal exercise of power than the unsettled
councils of a minority. In the parliament 6 R. II., sess. 2, the commons
pray certain lords, whom they name, to be assigned as their advisers. This
had been permitted in the two last sessions without
exception.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> But
the king, in granting their request, reserved his right of naming any
others.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
Though the commons did not relax in their importunities for
the redress of general grievances, they did not venture to intermeddle as
before with the conduct of administration. They did not even object to the
grant of the marquisate of Dublin, with almost a princely dominion over
Ireland; which enormous donation was confirmed by act of parliament to
Vere, a favourite of the
king.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
A petition that the officers of state
should annually visit and inquire into his household was answered that the
king would do what he
pleased.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Yet this was little in comparison of
their former proceedings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings of parliament in the tenth of Richard.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
There is nothing, however, more deceitful to a monarch, unsupported by an
armed force, and destitute of wary advisers, than this submission of his
people. A single effort was enough to overturn his government. Parliament
met in the tenth year of his reign, steadily determined to reform the
administration, and especially to punish its chief leader, Michael de la
Pole, earl of Suffolk and lord chancellor. According to the remarkable
narration of a contemporary
historian,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
too circumstantial to be
rejected, but rendered somewhat doubtful by the silence of all other
writers and of the parliamentary roll, the king was loitering at his
palace at Eltham when he received a message from the two houses,
requesting the dismissal of Suffolk, since they had matter to allege
against him that they could not move while he kept the office of
chancellor. Richard, with his usual intemperance, answered that he would
not for their request remove the meanest scullion from his kitchen. They
returned a positive refusal to proceed on any public business until the
king should appear personally in parliament and displace the chancellor.
The king required forty knights to be deputed from the rest to inform him
clearly of their wishes. But the commons declined a proposal in which they
feared, or affected to fear, some treachery. At length the duke of
Gloucester and Arundel bishop of Ely were commissioned to speak the sense
of parliament; and they delivered it, if we may still believe what we
read, in very extraordinary language, asserting that there was an ancient
statute, according to which, if the king absented himself from parliament
without just cause during forty days, which he had now exceeded, every man
might return without permission to his own country; and, moreover, there
was another statute, and (as they might more truly say) a precedent of no
remote date, that if a king, by bad counsel, or his own folly and
obstinacy, alienated himself from his people, and would not govern
according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the laws of the land and the advice of the peers, but madly
and wantonly followed his own single will, it should be lawful for them,
with the common assent of the people, to expel him from his throne, and
elevate to it some near kinsman of the royal blood. By this discourse the
king was induced to meet his parliament, where Suffolk was removed from
his office, and the impeachment against him
commenced.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Impeachment of Suffolk.</div>

<p>The charges against this minister, without being wholly frivolous, were
not so weighty as the clamour of the commons might have led us to expect.
Besides forfeiting all his grants from the crown, he was committed to
prison, there to remain till he should have paid such fine as the king
might impose; a sentence that would have been outrageously severe in many
cases, though little more than nugatory in the
present.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Commission of reform.</div>

<p>This was the second precedent of that grand constitutional resource,
parliamentary impeachment: and more remarkable from the eminence of the
person attacked than that of lord Latimer in the fiftieth year of Edward
III.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
The commons were content to waive the prosecution of any other
ministers; but they rather chose a scheme of reforming the administration,
which should avert both the necessity of punishment and the malversations
that provoked it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
They petitioned the king to ordain in parliament
certain chief officers of his household and other lords of his council,
with power to reform those abuses, by which his crown was so much
blemished that the laws were not kept and his revenues were dilapidated,
confirming by a statute a commission for a year, and forbidding, under
heavy penalties, any one from opposing, in private or openly, what they
should advise.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
With this the king complied, and a commission founded
upon the prayer of parliament was established by statute. It comprehended
fourteen persons of the highest eminence for rank and general estimation;
princes of the blood and ancient servants of the crown, by whom its
prerogatives were not likely to be unnecessarily impaired. In fact the
principle of this commission, without looking back at the precedents in
the reign of John, Henry III., and Edward II., which yet were not without
their weight as constitutional analogies, was merely that which the
commons had repeatedly maintained during the minority of the present king,
and which had produced the former commissions of reform in the third and
fifth years of his reign. These were upon the whole nearly the same in
their operation. It must be owned there was a more extensive sway
virtually given to the lords now appointed, by the penalties imposed on
any who should endeavour to obstruct what they might advise; the design as
well as tendency of which was no doubt to throw the whole administration
into their hands during the period of this commission.</p>

<p>Those who have written our history with more or less of a Tory bias
exclaim against this parliamentary commission as an unwarrantable
violation of the king's sovereignty, and even impartial men are struck at
first sight by a measure that seems to overset the natural balance of our
constitution. But it would be unfair to blame either those concerned in
this commission, some of whose names at least have been handed down with
unquestioned respect, or those high-spirited representatives of the people
whose patriot firmness has been hitherto commanding all our sympathy and
gratitude, unless we could distinctly pronounce by what gentler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> means
they could restrain the excesses of government. Thirteen parliaments had
already met since the accession of Richard; in all the same remonstrances
had been repeated, and the same promises renewed. Subsidies, more frequent
than in any former reign, had been granted for the supposed exigencies of
the war; but this was no longer illuminated by those dazzling victories
which give to fortune the mien of wisdom; the coasts of England were
perpetually ravaged, and her trade destroyed; while the administration
incurred the suspicion of diverting to private uses that treasure which
they so feebly and unsuccessfully applied to the public service. No voice
of his people, until it spoke in thunder, would stop an intoxicated boy in
the wasteful career of dissipation. He loved festivals and pageants, the
prevailing folly of his time, with unusual frivolity; and his ordinary
living is represented as beyond comparison more showy and sumptuous than
even that of his magnificent and chivalrous predecessor. Acts of
parliament were no adequate barriers to his misgovernment. "Of what avail
are statutes," says Walsingham, "since the king with his privy council is
wont to abolish what parliament has just
enacted?"<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> The constant
prayer of the commons in every session, that former statutes might be kept
in force, is no slight presumption that they were not secure of being
regarded. It may be true that Edward III.'s government had been full as
arbitrary, though not so unwise, as his grandson's; but this is the
strongest argument that nothing less than an extraordinary remedy could
preserve the still unstable liberties of England.</p>

<p>The best plea that could be made for Richard was his inexperience, and the
misguided suggestions of favourites. This, however, made it more necessary
to remove those false advisers, and to supply that inexperience.
Unquestionably the choice of ministers is reposed in the sovereign; a
trust, like every other attribute of legitimate power, for the public
good; not, what no legitimate power can ever be, the instrument of
selfishness or caprice. There is something more sacred than the
prerogative, or even than the constitution; the public weal, for which all
powers are granted, and to which they must all be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> referred. For this
public weal it is confessed to be sometimes necessary to shake the
possessor of the throne out of his seat; could it never be permitted to
suspend, though but indirectly and for a time, the positive exercise of
misapplied prerogatives? He has learned in a very different school from
myself, who denies to parliament at the present day a preventive as well
as vindictive control over the administration of affairs; a right of
resisting, by those means which lie within its sphere, the appointment of
unfit ministers. These means are now indirect; they need not to be the
less effectual, and they are certainly more salutary on that account. But
we must not make our notions of the constitution in its perfect symmetry
of manhood the measure of its infantine proportions, nor expect from a
parliament just struggling into life, and "pawing to get free its hinder
parts," the regularity of definite and habitual power.</p>

<p>It is assumed rather too lightly by some of those historians to whom I
have alluded that these commissioners, though but appointed for a
twelvemonth, designed to retain longer, or would not in fact have
surrendered, their authority. There is certainly a danger in these
delegations of pre-eminent trust; but I think it more formidable in a
republican form than under such a government as our own. The spirit of the
people, the letter of the law, were both so decidedly monarchical, that no
glaring attempt of the commissioners to keep the helm continually in their
hands, though it had been in the king's name, would have had a fair
probability of success. And an oligarchy of fourteen persons, different in
rank and profession, even if we should impute criminal designs to all of
them, was ill calculated for permanent union. Indeed the facility with
which Richard re-assumed his full powers two years afterwards, when
misconduct had rendered his circumstances far more unfavourable, gives the
corroboration of experience to this reasoning. By yielding to the will of
his parliament and to a temporary suspension of prerogative, this
unfortunate prince might probably have reigned long and peacefully; the
contrary course of acting led eventually to his deposition and miserable
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Answers of the judges to Richard's questions.</div>

<p>Before the dissolution of parliament Richard made a verbal protestation
that nothing done therein should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> in prejudice of his rights; a
reservation not unusual when any remarkable concession was made, but which
could not decently be interpreted, whatever he might mean, as a dissent
from the statute, just passed. Some months had intervened when the king,
who had already released Suffolk from prison and restored him to his
favour, procured from the judges, whom he had summoned to Nottingham, a
most convenient set of answers to questions concerning the late
proceedings in parliament. Tresilian and Belknap, chief justices of the
King's Bench and Common Pleas, with several other judges, gave it under
their seals that the late statute and commission were derogatory to the
prerogative; that all who procured it to be passed, or persuaded or
compelled the king to consent to it, were guilty of treason; that the
king's business must be proceeded upon before any other in parliament;
that he may put an end to the session at his pleasure; that his ministers
cannot be impeached without his consent; that any members of parliament
contravening the three last articles incur the penalties of treason, and
especially he who moved for the sentence of deposition against Edward II.
to be read; and that the judgment against the earl of Suffolk might be
revoked as altogether erroneous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subsequent revolution.</div>

<p>These answers, perhaps extorted by menaces, as all the judges, except
Tresilian, protested before the next parliament, were for the most part
servile and unconstitutional. The indignation which they excited, and the
measures successfully taken to withstand the king's designs, belong to
general history; but I shall pass slightly over that season of turbulence,
which afforded no legitimate precedent, to our constitutional annals. Of
the five lords appellants, as they were called, Gloucester, Derby,
Nottingham, Warwick, and Arundel, the three former, at least, have little
claim to our esteem; but in every age it is the sophism of malignant and
peevish men to traduce the cause of freedom itself, on account of the
interested motives by which its ostensible advocates have frequently been
actuated. The parliament, who had the country thoroughly with them, acted
no doubt honestly, but with an inattention to the rules of law, culpable
indeed, yet from which the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> civilized of their successors, in the
heat of passion and triumph, have scarcely been exempt. Whether all with
whom they dealt severely, some of them apparently of good previous
reputation, merited such punishment, is more than, upon uncertain
evidence, a modern writer can profess to
decide.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[h]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the death or exile of all Richard's favourites, and the
oath taken not only by parliament, but by every class of the people, to
stand by the lords appellants, we find him, after about a year, suddenly
annihilating their pretensions, and snatching the reins again without
obstruction. The secret cause of this event is among the many obscurities
that attend the history of his reign. It was conducted with a spirit and
activity which broke out two or three times in the course of his imprudent
life; but we may conjecture that he had the advantage of disunion among
his enemies. For some years after this the king's administration was
prudent. The great seal, which he took away from archbishop Arundel, he
gave to Wykeham bishop of Winchester, another member of the reforming
commission, but a man of great moderation and political experience. Some
time after he restored the seal to Arundel, and reinstated the duke of
Gloucester in the council. The duke of Lancaster, who had been absent
during the transactions of the tenth and eleventh years of the king, in
prosecution of his Castilian war, formed a link between the parties, and
seems to have maintained some share of public favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greater harmony between the king and parliament.</div>

<p>There was now a more apparent harmony between the court and the
parliament. It seems to have been tacitly agreed that they should not
interfere with the king's household expenses; and they gratified him in a
point where his honour had been most wounded, declaring his prerogative to
be as high and unimpaired as that of his predecessors, and repealing the
pretended statute by virtue of which Edward II. was said to have been
deposed.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>.
They were provident enough, however, to grant conditional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
subsidies, to be levied only in case of a royal expedition against the
enemy; and several were accordingly remitted by proclamation, this
condition not being fulfilled. Richard never ventured to recall his
favourites, though he testified his unabated affection for Vere by a
pompous funeral. Few complaints, unequivocally affecting the ministry,
were presented by the commons. In one parliament the chancellor,
treasurer, and counsel resigned their offices, submitting themselves to
its judgment in case any matter of accusation should be alleged against
them. The commons, after a day's deliberation, probably to make their
approbation appear more solemn, declared in full parliament that nothing
amiss had been found in the conduct of these ministers, and that they held
them to have faithfully discharged their duties. The king reinstated them
accordingly, with a protestation that this should not be made a precedent,
and that it was his right to change his servants at
pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disunion among some leading peers.</div>

<p>But this summer season was not to last for ever. Richard had but
dissembled with those concerned in the transactions of 1388, none of whom
he could ever forgive. These lords in lapse of time were divided among
each other. The earls of Derby and Nottingham were brought into the king's
interest. The earl of Arundel came to an open breach with the duke of
Lancaster, whose pardon he was compelled to ask for an unfounded
accusation in parliament.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Gloucester's ungoverned ambition, elated by
popularity, could not brook the ascendency of his brother Lancaster, who
was much less odious to the king. He had constantly urged and defended the
concession of Guienne to this prince to be held for life, reserving only
his liege homage to Richard as king of
France;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
a grant as unpopular
among the natives of that country as it was derogatory to the crown; but
Lancaster was not much indebted to his brother for assistance which was
only given in order to diminish his influence in England. The truce with
France, and the king's French marriage, which Lancaster supported, were
passionately opposed by Gloucester. And the latter had given keener
provocation by speaking contemptuously of that misalliance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> with Katherine
Swineford which contaminated the blood of Plantagenet. To the parliament
summoned in the 20th of Richard, one object of which was to legitimate the
duke of Lancaster's antenuptial children by this lady, neither Gloucester
nor Arundel would repair. There passed in this assembly something
remarkable, as it exhibits not only the arbitrary temper of the king, a
point by no means doubtful, but the inefficiency of the commons to resist
it without support from political confederacies of the nobility. The
circumstances are thus related in the record.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard's prosecution of Haxey.</div>

<p>During the session the king sent for the lords into parliament one
afternoon, and told them how he had heard of certain articles of complaint
made by the commons in conference with them a few days before, some of
which appeared to the king against his royalty, estate, and liberty, and
commanded the chancellor to inform him fully as to this. The chancellor
accordingly related the whole matter, which consisted of four alleged
grievances; namely, that sheriffs and escheators, notwithstanding a
statute, are continued in their offices beyond a
year;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> that the
Scottish marches were not well kept; that the statute against wearing
great men's liveries was disregarded; and, lastly, that the excessive
charges of the king's household ought to be diminished, arising from the
multitude of bishops and of ladies who are there maintained at his cost.</p>

<p>Upon this information the king declared to the lords that through God's
gift he is by lineal right of inheritance king of England, and will have
the royalty and freedom of his crown, from which some of these articles
derogate. The first petition, that sheriffs should never remain in office
beyond a year, he rejected; but, passing lightly over the rest, took most
offence that the commons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
who are his lieges, should take on themselves
to make any ordinance respecting his royal person or household, or those
whom he might please to have about him. He enjoined therefore the lords to
declare plainly to the commons his pleasure in this matter; and especially
directed the duke of Lancaster to make the speaker give up the name of the
person who presented a bill for this last article in the lower house.</p>

<p>The commons were in no state to resist this unexpected promptitude of
action in the king. They surrendered the obnoxious bill, with its
proposer, one Thomas Haxey, and with great humility made excuse that they
never designed to give offence to his majesty, nor to interfere with his
household or attendants, knowing well that such things do not belong to
them, but to the king alone; but merely to draw his attention, that he
might act therein as should please him best. The king forgave these
pitiful suppliants; but Haxey was adjudged in parliament to suffer death
as a traitor. As, however, he was a
clerk,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> the archbishop of
Canterbury, at the head of the prelates, obtained of the king that his
life might be spared, and that they might have the custody of his person;
protesting that this was not claimed by way of right, but merely of the
king's grace.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arbitrary measures of the king.</div>

<p>This was an open defiance of parliament, and a declaration of arbitrary
power. For it would be impossible to contend that, after the repeated
instances of control over public expenditure by the commons since the 50th
of Edward III., this principle was novel and unauthorized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
by the
constitution, or that the right of free speech demanded by them in every
parliament was not a real and indisputable privilege. The king, however,
was completely successful, and, having proved the feebleness of the
commons, fell next upon those he more dreaded. By a skilful piece of
treachery he seized the duke of Gloucester, and spread consternation among
all his party. A parliament was summoned, in which the only struggle was
to outdo the king's wishes, and thus to efface their former
transgressions.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
Gloucester, who had been murdered at Calais, was
attainted after his death; Arundel was beheaded, his brother the
archbishop of Canterbury deposed and banished, Warwick and Cobham sent
beyond sea. The commission of the tenth, the proceedings in parliament of
the eleventh year of the king, were annulled. The answers of the judges to
the questions put at Nottingham, which had been punished with death and
exile, were pronounced by parliament to be just and legal. It was declared
high treason to procure the repeal of any judgment against persons therein
impeached. Their issue male were disabled from ever sitting in parliament
or holding place in council. These violent ordinances, as if the precedent
they were then overturning had not shielded itself with the same sanction,
were sworn to by parliament upon the cross of Canterbury, and confirmed by
a national oath, with the penalty of excommunication denounced against its
infringers. Of those recorded to have bound themselves by this adjuration
to Richard, far the greater part had touched the same relics for
Gloucester and Arundel ten years before, and two years afterwards swore
allegiance to Henry of
Lancaster.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[s]</a></p>

<p>In the fervour of prosecution this parliament could hardly go beyond that
whose acts they were annulling; and each is alike unworthy to be
remembered in the way of precedent. But the leaders of the former, though
vindictive and turbulent, had a concern for the public interest; and,
after punishing their enemies, left the government upon its right
foundation. In this all regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
for liberty was extinct; and the commons
set the dangerous precedent of granting the king a subsidy upon wool
during his life. Their remarkable act of severity was accompanied by
another, less unexampled, but, as it proved, of more ruinous tendency. The
petitions of the commons not having been answered during the session,
which they were always anxious to conclude, a commission was granted for
twelve peers and six commoners to sit after the dissolution, and "examine,
answer, and fully determine, as well all the said petitions, and the
matters therein comprised, as all other matters and things moved in the
king's presence, and all things incident thereto not yet determined, as
shall seem best to
them."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
The "other matters" mentioned above were, I
suppose, private petitions to the king's council in parliament, which had
been frequently despatched after a dissolution. For in the statute which
establishes this commission, 21 R. II. c. 16, no powers are committed but
those of examining petitions: which, if it does not confirm the charge
afterwards alleged against Richard, of falsifying the parliament roll,
must at least be considered as limiting and explaining the terms of the
latter. Such a trust had been committed to some lords of the council eight
years before, in very peaceful times; and it was even requested that the
same might be done in future
parliaments.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
But it is obvious what a
latitude this gave to a prevailing faction. These eighteen commissioners,
or some of them (for there were who disliked the turn of affairs), usurped
the full rights of the legislature, which undoubtedly were only delegated
in respect of business already
commenced.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
They imposed a perpetual
oath on prelates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and lords for all time to come, to be taken before
obtaining livery of their lands, that they would maintain the statutes and
ordinances made by this parliament, or "afterwards by the lords and
knights having power committed to them by the same." They declared it high
treason to disobey their ordinances. They annulled the patents of the
dukes of Hereford and Norfolk, and adjudged Henry Bowet, the former's
chaplain, who had advised him to petition for his inheritance, to the
penalties of treason.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
And thus, having obtained a revenue for life,
and the power of parliament being notoriously usurped by a knot of his
creatures, the king was little likely to meet his people again, and became
as truly absolute as his ambition could require.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quarrel of the dukes of Hereford and Norfolk.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity for deposing Richard II.</div>

<p>It had been necessary for this purpose to subjugate the ancient nobility.
For the English constitution gave them such paramount rights that it was
impossible either to make them surrender their country's freedom, or to
destroy it without their consent. But several of the chief men had fallen
or were involved with the party of Gloucester. Two who, having once
belonged to it, had lately plunged into the depths of infamy to ruin their
former friends; were still perfectly obnoxious to the king, who never
forgave their original sin. These two, Henry of Bolingbroke, earl of
Derby, and Mowbray, earl of Nottingham, now dukes of Hereford and Norfolk,
the most powerful of the remaining nobility, were, by a singular
conjuncture, thrown, as it were, at the king's feet. Of the political
mysteries which this reign affords, none is more inexplicable than the
quarrel of these peers. In the parliament at Shrewsbury, in 1398, Hereford
was called upon by the king to relate what had passed between the duke of
Norfolk and himself in slander of his majesty. He detailed a pretty long
and not improbable conversation, in which Norfolk had asserted the king's
intention of destroying them both for their old offence in impeaching his
ministers. Norfolk had only to deny the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
charge and throw his gauntlet at
the accuser. It was referred to the eighteen commissioners who sat after
the dissolution, and a trial by combat was awarded. But when this, after
many delays, was about to take place at Coventry, Richard interfered and
settled the dispute by condemning Hereford to banishment for ten years and
Norfolk for life. This strange determination, which treated both as guilty
where only one could be so, seems to admit no other solution than the
king's desire to rid himself of two peers whom he feared and hated at a
blow. But it is difficult to understand by what means he drew the crafty
Bolingbroke into his
snare.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
However this might have been, he now
threw away all appearance of moderate government. The indignities he had
suffered in the eleventh year of his reign were still at his heart, a
desire to revenge which seems to have been the mainspring of his conduct.
Though a general pardon of those proceedings had been granted, not only at
the time, but in his own last parliament, he made use of them as a
pretence to extort money from seventeen counties, to whom he imputed a
share in the rebellion. He compelled men to confess under their seals that
they had been guilty of treason, and to give blank obligations, which his
officers filled up with large
sums.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Upon the death of the duke of
Lancaster, who had passively complied throughout all these transactions,
Richard refused livery of his inheritance to Hereford, whose exile implied
no crime, and who had letters patent enabling him to make his attorney for
that purpose during its continuance. In short, his government for nearly
two years was altogether tyrannical; and, upon the same principles that
cost James II. his throne, it was unquestionably far more necessary,
unless our fathers would have abandoned all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
thought of liberty, to expel
Richard II. Far be it from us to extenuate the treachery of the Percies
towards this unhappy prince, or the cruel circumstances of his death, or
in any way to extol either his successor or the chief men of that time,
most of whom were ambitious and faithless; but after such long experience
of the king's arbitrary, dissembling, and revengeful temper, I see no
other safe course, in the actual state of the constitution, than what the
nation concurred in pursuing.</p>

<p>The reign of Richard II. is, in a constitutional light, the most
interesting part of our earlier history; and it has been the most
imperfectly written. Some have misrepresented the truth through prejudice,
and others through carelessness. It is only to be understood, and, indeed,
there are great difficulties in the way of understanding it at all, by a
perusal of the rolls of parliament, with some assistance from the
contemporary historians, Walsingham, Knyghton, the anonymous biographer
published by Hearne, and Froissart. These, I must remark, except
occasionally the last, are extremely hostile to Richard; and although we
are far from being bound to acquiesce in their opinions, it is at least
unwarrantable in modern writers to sprinkle their margins with references
to such authority in support of positions decidedly
opposite.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Circumstances attending Henry IV.'s accession.</div>

<p>The revolution which elevated Henry IV. to the throne was certainly so far
accomplished by force, that the king was in captivity, and those who might
still adhere to him in no condition to support his authority. But the
sincere concurrence which most of the prelates and nobility, with the mass
of the people, gave to changes that could not have been otherwise effected
by one so unprovided with foreign support as Henry, proves this revolution
to have been, if not an indispensable, yet a national act, and should
prevent our considering the Lancastrian kings as usurpers of the throne.
Nothing indeed looks so much like usurpation in the whole transaction as Henry's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
remarkable challenge of the crown, insinuating, though not
avowing, as Hume has justly animadverted upon it, a false and ridiculous
title by right line of descent, and one equally unwarrantable by conquest.
The course of proceedings is worthy of notice. As the renunciation of
Richard might well pass for the effect of compulsion, there was a strong
reason for propping up its instability by a solemn deposition from the
throne, founded upon specific charges of misgovernment. Again, as the
right of dethroning a monarch was nowhere found in the law, it was equally
requisite to support this assumption of power by an actual abdication. But
as neither one nor the other filled up the duke of Lancaster's wishes, who
was not contented with owing a crown to election, nor seemed altogether to
account for the exclusion of the house of March, he devised this claim,
which was preferred in the vacancy of the throne, Richard's cession,
having been read and approved in parliament, and the sentence of
deposition, "out of abundant caution, and to remove all scruple," solemnly
passed by seven commissioners appointed out of the several estates. "After
which challenge and claim," says the record, "the lords spiritual and
temporal, and all the estates there present, being asked, separately and
together, what they thought of the said challenge and claim, the said
estates, with the whole people, without any difficulty or delay, consented
that the said duke should reign over
them."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
The claim of Henry, as
opposed to that of the earl of March, was indeed ridiculous; but it is by
no means evident that, in such cases of extreme urgency as leave no
security for the common weal but the deposition of a reigning prince,
there rests any positive obligation upon the estates of the realm to fill
his place with the nearest heir. A revolution of this kind seems rather to
defeat and confound all prior titles; though in the new settlement it will
commonly be prudent, as well as equitable, to treat them with some regard.
Were this otherwise it would be hard to say why William III. reigned to
the exclusion of Anne, or even of the Pretender, who had surely committed
no offence at that time; or why (if such indeed be the true construction
of the Act of Settlement)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the more distant branches of the royal stock,
descendants of Henry VII. and earlier kings, have been cut off from their
hope of succession by the restriction to the heirs of the princess Sophia.</p>

<p>In this revolution of 1399 there was as remarkable an attention shown to
the formalities of the constitution, allowance made for the men and the
times, as in that of 1688. The parliament was not opened by commission; no
one took the office of president; the commons did not adjourn to their own
chamber; they chose no speaker; the name of parliament was not taken, but
that only of estates of the realm. But as it would have been a violation
of constitutional principles to assume a parliamentary character without
the king's commission, though summoned by his writ, so it was still more
essential to limit their exercise of power to the necessity of
circumstances. Upon the cession of the king, as upon his death, the
parliament was no more; its existence, as the council of the sovereign,
being dependent upon his will. The actual convention summoned by the writs
of Richard could not legally become the parliament of Henry; and the
validity of a statute declaring it to be such would probably have been
questionable in that age, when the power of statutes to alter the original
principles of the common law was by no means so thoroughly recognised as
at the Restoration and Revolution. Yet Henry was too well pleased with his
friends to part with them so readily; and he had much to effect before the
fervour of their spirits should abate. Hence an expedient was devised of
issuing writs for a new parliament, returnable in six days. These neither
were nor could be complied with; but the same members as had deposed
Richard sat in the new parliament, which was regularly opened by Henry's
commissioner as if they had been duly
elected.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
In this contrivance, more than in all the rest, we may trace the hand of lawyers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retrospect of the progress of the constitution under Richard II.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Its advances under the house of Lancaster.</div>

<p>If we look back from the accession of Henry IV. to that of his
predecessor, the constitutional authority of the house of commons will be
perceived to have made surprising progress during the course of twenty-two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
years. Of the three capital points in contest while Edward
reigned, that money could not be levied, or laws enacted, without the
commons' consent, and that the administration of government was subject to
their inspection and control, the first was absolutely decided in their
favour, the second was at least perfectly admitted in principle, and the
last was confirmed by frequent exercise. The commons had acquired two
additional engines of immense efficiency; one, the right of directing the
application of subsidies, and calling accountants before them; the other,
that of impeaching the king's ministers for misconduct. All these vigorous
shoots of liberty throve more and more under the three kings of the house
of Lancaster, and drew such strength and nourishment from the generous
heart of England, that in after-times, and in a less prosperous season,
though checked and obstructed in their growth, neither the blasts of
arbitrary power could break them off, nor the mildew of servile opinion
cause them to wither. I shall trace the progress of parliament till the
civil wars of York and Lancaster: 1. in maintaining the exclusive right of
taxation; 2. in directing and checking the public expenditure; 3. in
making supplies depend on the redress of grievances; 4. in securing the
people against illegal ordinances and interpolations of the statutes; 5.
in controlling the royal administration; 6. in punishing bad ministers;
and lastly, in establishing their own immunities and privileges.</p>

<p>1. The pretence of levying money without consent of parliament expired
with Edward III., who had asserted it, as we have seen, in the very last
year of his reign. A great council of lords and prelates, summoned in the
second year of his successor, declared that they could advise no remedy
for the king's necessities without laying taxes on the people, which could
only be granted in
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Nor was Richard ever accused of
illegal tallages, the frequent theme of remonstrance under Edward, unless
we may conjecture that this charge is implied in an act (11 R. II. c. 9)
which annuls all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
impositions on wool and leather, without consent of
parliament, <i>if any there
be</i>.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
Doubtless his innocence in this
respect was the effect of weakness; and if the revolution of 1399 had not
put an end to his newly acquired despotism, this, like every other right
of his people, would have been swept away. A less palpable means of
evading the consent of the commons was by the extortion of loans, and
harassing those who refused to pay by summonses before the council. These
loans, the frequent resource of arbitrary sovereigns in later times, are
first complained of in an early parliament of Richard II.: and a petition
is granted that no man shall be compelled to lend the king
money.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> But
how little this was regarded we may infer from a writ directed, in 1386,
to some persons in Boston, enjoining them to assess every person who had
goods and chattels to the amount of twenty pounds, in his proportion of
two hundred pounds, which the town had promised to lend the king; and
giving an assurance that this shall be deducted from the next subsidy to
be granted by parliament. Among other extraordinary parts of this letter
is a menace of forfeiting life, limbs, and property, held out against such
as should not obey these
commissioners.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
After his triumph over the
popular party towards the end of his reign, he obtained large sums in this
way.</p>

<p>Under the Lancastrian kings there is much less appearance of raising money
in an unparliamentary course. Henry IV. obtained an aid from a great
council in the year 1400; but they did not pretend to charge any besides
themselves; though it seems that some towns afterwards gave the king a
contribution.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
A few years afterwards he directs the sheriffs to call
on the richest men in their counties to advance the money voted by
parliament. This, if any compulsion was threatened, is an instance of
overstrained prerogative, though consonant to the practice of the late
reign.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
There is, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
an instance of very arbitrary conduct with
respect to a grant of money in the minority of Henry VI. A subsidy had
been granted by parliament upon goods imported under certain restrictions
in favour of the merchants, with a provision that, if these conditions be
not observed on the king's part, then the grant should be void and of no
effect.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
But an entry is made on the roll of the next parliament,
that, "whereas some disputes have arisen about the grant of the last
subsidy, it is declared by the duke of Bedford and other lords in
parliament, with advice of the judges and others learned in the law, that
the said subsidy was at all events to be collected and levied for the
king's use; notwithstanding any conditions in the grant of the said
subsidy contained."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
The commons, however, in making the grant of a
fresh subsidy in this parliament, renewed their former conditions, with
the addition of another, that "it ne no part thereof be beset ne dispensed
to no other use, but only in and for the defense of the said
roialme."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[o]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Appropriation of supplies.</div>

<p>2. The right of granting supplies would have been very incomplete, had it
not been accompanied with that of directing their application. The
principle of appropriating public moneys began, as we have seen, in the
minority of Richard; and was among the best fruits of that period. It was
steadily maintained under the new dynasty. The parliament of 6 H. IV.
granted two fifteenths and two tenths, with a tax on skins and wool, on
condition that it should be expended in the defence of the kingdom, and
not otherwise, as Thomas lord Furnival and Sir John Pelham, ordained
treasurers of war for this parliament, to receive the said subsidies,
shall account and answer to the commons at the next parliament. These
treasurers were sworn in parliament to execute their
trusts.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> A
similar precaution was adopted in the next
session.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to make supply depend on redress of grievances.</div>

<p>3. The commons made a bold attempt in the second year of Henry IV. to give
the strongest security to their claims of redress, by inverting the usual
course of parliamentary proceedings. It was usual to answer their
petitions on the last day of the session, which put an end to all further discussion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
upon them, and prevented their making the redress of
grievances a necessary condition of supply. They now requested that an
answer might be given before they made their grant of subsidy. This was
one of the articles which Richard II.'s judges had declared it high
treason to attempt. Henry was not inclined to make a concession which
would virtually have removed the chief impediment to the ascendency of
parliament. He first said that he would consult with the lords, and answer
according to their advice. On the last day of the session the commons were
informed that "it had never been known in the time of his ancestors that
they should have their petitions answered before they had done all their
business in parliament, whether of granting money or any other concern;
wherefore the king will not alter the good customs and usages of ancient
times."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the just views these parliaments appear generally to have
entertained of their power over the public purse, that of the third of
Henry V. followed a precedent from the worst times of Richard II., by
granting the king a subsidy on wool and leather during his
life.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
This, an historian tells us, Henry IV. had vainly laboured to
obtain;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
but the taking of Harfleur intoxicated the English with new dreams of
conquest in France, which their good sense and constitutional jealousy
were not firm enough to resist. The continued expenses of the war,
however, prevented this grant from becoming so dangerous as it might have
been in a season of tranquillity. Henry V., like his father, convoked
parliament almost in every year of his reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Legislative rights of the commons established.</div>

<p>4. It had long been out of all question that the legislature consisted of
the king, lords, and commons; or, in stricter language, that the king
could not make or repeal statutes without the consent of parliament. But
this fundamental maxim was still frequently defeated by various acts of
evasion or violence; which, though protested against as illegal, it was a
difficult task to prevent. The king sometimes exerted a power of
suspending the observance of statutes, as in the ninth of Richard II.,
when a petition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
that all statutes might be confirmed is granted, with an
exception as to one passed in the last parliament, forbidding the judges
to take fees, or give counsel in cases where the king was a party; which,
"because it was too severe and needs declaration, the king would have of
no effect till it should be declared in
parliament."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
The apprehension of the dispensing prerogative and sense of its illegality are manifested
by the wary terms wherein the commons, in one of Richard's parliaments,
"assent that the king make such sufferance respecting the statute of
provisors as shall seem reasonable to him, so that the said statute be not
repealed; and, moreover, that the commons may disagree thereto at the next
parliament, and resort to the statute;" with a protestation that this
assent, which is a novelty and never done before, shall not be drawn into
precedent; praying the king that this protestation may be entered on the
roll of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
A petition, in one of Henry IV.'s parliaments, to
limit the number of attorneys, and forbid filazers and prothonotaries from
practising, having been answered favourably as to the first point, we find
a marginal entry in the roll that the prince and council had respited the
execution of this act.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dispensing power of the crown.</div>

<p>The dispensing power, as exercised in favour of individuals, is quite of a
different character from this general suspension of statutes, but
indirectly weakens the sovereignty of the legislature. This power was
exerted, and even recognised, throughout all the reigns of the
Plantagenets. In the first of Henry V. the commons pray that the statute
for driving aliens out of the kingdom be executed. The king assents,
saving his prerogative and his right of dispensing with it when he
pleased. To which the commons replied that their intention was never
otherwise, nor, by God's help, ever should be. At the same time one Rees
ap Thomas petitions the king to modify or dispense with the statute
prohibiting Welchmen from purchasing lands in England, or the English towns in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Wales; which the king grants. In the same parliament the commons
pray that no grant or protection be made to any one in contravention of
the statute of provisors, saving the king's prerogative. He merely
answers, "Let the statutes be observed:" evading any allusion to his

<p>It has been observed, under the reign of Edward III., that the practice of
leaving statutes to be drawn up by the judges, from the petition and
answer jointly, after a dissolution of parliament, presented an
opportunity of falsifying the intention of the legislature, whereof
advantage was often taken. Some very remarkable instances of this fraud
occurred in the succeeding reigns.</p>

<p>An ordinance was put upon the roll of parliament, in the fifth of Richard
II., empowering sheriffs of counties to arrest preachers of heresy and
their abettors, and detain them in prison till they should justify
themselves before the church. This was introduced into the statutes of the
year; but the assent of lords and commons is not expressed. In the next
parliament the commons, reciting this ordinance, declare that it was never
assented to or granted by them, but what had been proposed in this matter
was without their concurrence (that is, as I conceive, had been rejected
by them), and pray that this statute be annulled; for it was never their
intent to bind themselves or their descendants to the bishops more than
their ancestors had been bound in times past. The king returned an answer,
agreeing to this petition. Nevertheless the pretended statute was
untouched, and remains still among our
laws;<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
unrepealed, except by desuetude, and by inference from the acts of much later times.</p>

<p>This commendable reluctance of the commons to let the clergy forge chains
for them produced, as there is much appearance, a similar violation of
their legislative rights in the next reign. The statute against heresy in
the second of Henry IV. is not grounded upon any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
petition of the commons,
but only upon one of the clergy. It is said to be enacted by consent of
the lords, but no notice is taken of the lower house in the parliament
roll, though the statute reciting the petition asserts the commons to have
joined in it.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
The petition and the statute are both in Latin, which
is unusual in the laws of this time. In a subsequent petition of the
commons this act is styled "the statute made in the second year of your
majesty's reign at the request of the prelates and clergy of your
kingdom;" which affords a presumption that it had no regular assent of
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
And the spirit of the commons during this whole reign
being remarkably hostile to the church, it would have been hardly possible
to obtain their consent to so penal a law against heresy. Several of their
petitions seem designed indirectly to weaken its
efficacy.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>These infringements of their most essential right were resisted by the
commons in various ways, according to the measure of their power. In the
fifth of Richard II. they request the lords to let them see a certain
ordinance before it is
engrossed.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
At another time they procured some
of their own members, as well as peers, to be present at engrossing the
roll. At length they spoke out unequivocally in a memorable petition,
which, besides its intrinsic importance, is deserving of notice as the
earliest instance in which the house of commons adopted the English
language. I shall present its venerable orthography without change.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fulness of this assent to so important a petition we
find no vestige of either among the statutes, and the whole transaction is
unnoticed by those historians who have not looked into our original
records. If the compilers of the statute-roll were able to keep out of it
the very provision that was intended to check their fraudulent
machinations, it was in vain to hope for redress without altering the
established practice in this respect; and indeed, where there was no
design to falsify the roll it was impossible to draw up statutes which
should be in truth the acts of the whole legislature, so long as the king
continued to grant petitions in part, and to engraft new matter upon them. Such was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
still the case till the commons hit upon an effectual expedient
for screening themselves against these encroachments, which has lasted
without alteration to the present day. This was the introduction of
complete statutes under the name of bills, instead of the old petitions;
and these containing the royal assent and the whole form of a law, it
became, though not quite
immediately,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
a constant principle that the
king must admit or reject them without qualification. This alteration,
which wrought an extraordinary effect on the character of our
constitution, was gradually introduced in Henry VI.'s
reign.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[h]</a></p>

<p>From the first years of Henry V., though not, I think, earlier, the
commons began to concern themselves with the petitions of individuals to
the lords or council. The nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the
latter will be treated more fully hereafter; it is only necessary to
mention in this place that many of the requests preferred to them were
such as could not be granted without transcending the boundaries of law. A
just inquietude as to the encroachments of the king's council had long
been manifested by the commons; and finding remonstrances ineffectual,
they took measures for preventing such usurpations of legislative power by
introducing their own consent to private petitions. These were now
presented by the hands of the commons, and in very many instances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> passed
in the form of statutes with the express assent of all parts of the
legislature. Such was the origin of private bills, which occupy the
greater part of the rolls in Henry V. and VI.'s parliament. The commons
once made an ineffectual endeavour to have their consent to all petitions
presented to the council in parliament rendered necessary by law; if I
rightly apprehend the meaning of the roll in this place, which seems
obscure or corrupt.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Interference of parliament with the royal expenditure.</div>

<p>5. If the strength of the commons had lain merely in the weakness of the
crown, it might be inferred that such harassing interference with the
administration of affairs as the youthful and frivolous Richard was
compelled to endure would have been sternly repelled by his experienced
successor. But, on the contrary, the spirit of Richard might have rejoiced
to see that his mortal enemy suffered as hard usage at the hands of
parliament as himself. After a few years the government of Henry became
extremely unpopular. Perhaps his dissension with the great family of
Percy, which had placed him on the throne, and was regarded with
partiality by the
people,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
chiefly contributed to this alienation of
their attachment. The commons requested, in the fifth of his reign, that
certain persons might be removed from the court; the lords concurred in
displacing four of these, one being the king's confessor. Henry came down
to parliament and excused these four persons, as knowing no special cause
why they should be removed; yet, well understanding that what the lords
and commons should ordain would be for his and his kingdom's interest, and
therefore anxious to conform himself to their wishes, consented to the
said ordinance, and charged the persons in question to leave his palace;
adding, that he would do as much by any other about his person whom he
should find to have incurred the ill affection of his
people.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> It was
in the same session that the archbishop of Canterbury was commanded to
declare before the lords the king's intention respecting his
administration; allowing that some things had been done amiss in his court and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
household; and therefore, wishing to conform to the will of God and
laws of the land, protested that he would let in future no letters of
signet or privy seal go in disturbance of law, beseeched the lords to put
his household in order, so that every one might be paid, and declared that
the money granted by the commons for the war should be received by
treasurers appointed in parliament, and disbursed by them for no other
purpose, unless in case of rebellion. At the request of the commons he
named the members of his privy council; and did the same, with some
variation of persons, two years afterwards. These, though not nominated
with the express consent, seem to have had the approbation of the commons,
for a subsidy is granted in 7 H. IV., among other causes, for "the great
trust that the commons have in the lords lately chosen and ordained to be
of the king's continual council, that there shall be better management
than heretofore."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<p>In the sixth year of Henry the parliament, which Sir E. Coke derides as
unlearned because lawyers were excluded from it, proceeded to a resumption
of grants and a prohibition of alienating the ancient inheritance of the
crown without consent of parliament, in order to ease the commons of
taxes, and that the king might live on his
own.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
This was a favourite
though rather chimerical project. In a later parliament it was requested
that the king would take his council's advice how to keep within his own
revenue; he answered that he would willingly comply as soon as it should
be in his power.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<p>But no parliament came near, in the number and boldness of its demands, to
that held in the eighth year of Henry IV. The commons presented thirty-one
articles, none of which the king ventured to refuse, though pressing very
severely upon his prerogative. He was to name sixteen counsellors, by
whose advice he was solely to be guided, none of them to be dismissed
without conviction of misdemeanor. The chancellor and privy seal to pass
no grants or other matter contrary to law. Any persons about the court
stirring up the king or queen's minds against their subjects, and duly
convicted thereof, to lose their offices and be fined. The king's ordinary revenue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
was wholly appropriated to his household and the payment of his
debts; no grant of wardship or other profit to be made thereout, nor any
forfeiture to be pardoned. The king, "considering the wise government of
other Christian princes, and conforming himself thereto," was to assign
two days in the week for petitions, "it being an honourable and necessary
thing that his lieges, who desired to petition him, should be heard." No
judicial officer, nor any in the revenue or household, to enjoy his place
for life or term of years. No petition to be presented to the king, by any
of his household, at times when the council were not sitting. The council
to determine nothing cognizable at common law, unless for a reasonable
cause and with consent of the judges. The statutes regulating purveyance
were affirmed&mdash;abuses of various kinds in the council and in courts of
justice enumerated and forbidden&mdash;elections of knights for counties put
under regulation. The council and officers of state were sworn to observe
the common law and all statutes, those especially just
enacted.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<p>It must strike every reader that these provisions were of themselves a
noble fabric of constitutional liberty, and hardly perhaps inferior to the
petition of right under Charles I. We cannot account for the submission of
Henry to conditions far more derogatory than ever were imposed on Richard,
because the secret politics of his reign are very imperfectly understood.
Towards its close he manifested more vigour. The speaker, Sir Thomas
Chaucer, having made the usual petition for liberty of speech, the king
answered that he might speak as others had done in the time of his
(Henry's) ancestors, and his own, but not otherwise; for he would by no
means have any innovation, but be as much at his liberty as any of his
ancestors had ever been. Some time after he sent a message to the commons,
complaining of a law passed at the last parliament infringing his liberty
and prerogative, which he requested their consent to repeal. To this the
commons agreed, and received the king's thanks, who declared at the same
time that he would keep as much freedom and prerogative as any of his
ancestors. It does not appear what was the particular subject of complaint;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
but there had been much of the same remonstrating spirit in
the last parliament that was manifested on preceding occasions. The
commons, however, for reasons we cannot explain, were rather dismayed.
Before their dissolution, they petition the king, that, whereas he was
reported to be offended at some of his subjects in this and in the
preceding parliament, he would openly declare that he held them all for
loyal subjects. Henry granted this "of his special grace;" and thus
concluded his reign more triumphantly with respect to his domestic battles
than he had gone through it.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry V. His popularity.</div>

<p>Power deemed to be ill gotten is naturally precarious; and the instance of
Henry IV. has been well quoted to prove that public liberty flourishes
with a bad title in the sovereign. None of our kings seem to have been
less beloved; and indeed he had little claim to affection. But what men
denied to the reigning king they poured in full measure upon the heir of
his throne. The virtues of the prince of Wales are almost invidiously
eulogized by those parliaments who treat harshly his
father;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> and
these records afford a strong presumption that some early petulance or
riot has been much exaggerated by the vulgar minds of our chroniclers. One
can scarcely understand at least that a prince who was three years engaged
in quelling the dangerous insurrection of Glendower, and who in the latter
time of his father's reign presided at the council, was so lost in a cloud
of low debauchery as common fame
represents.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
Loved he certainly was
throughout his life, as so intrepid, affable, and generous a temper well
deserved; and this sentiment was heightened to admiration by successes
still more rapid and dazzling than those of Edward III. During his reign
there scarcely appears any vestige of dissatisfaction in parliament&mdash;a
circumstance very honourable, whether we ascribe it to the justice of his
administration or to the affection of his people. Perhaps two exceptions,
though they are rather one in spirit, might be made: the first, a petition
to the duke of Gloucester, then holding parliament as guardian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> of
England, that he would move the king and queen to return, as speedily as
might please them, in relief and comfort of the
commons;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> the second,
a request that their petitions might not be sent to the king beyond sea,
but altogether determined "within this kingdom of England, during this
parliament," and that this ordinance might be of force in all future
parliaments to be held in
England.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
This prayer, to which the guardian
declined to accede, evidently sprang from the apprehensions, excited in
their minds by the treaty of Troyes, that England might become a province
of the French crown, which led them to obtain a renewal of the statute of
Edward III., declaring the independence of this
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament consulted on all public affairs.</div>

<p>It has been seen already that even Edward III. consulted his parliament
upon the expediency of negociations for peace, though at that time the
commons had not acquired boldness enough to tender their advice. In
Richard II.'s reign they answered to a similar proposition with a little
more confidence, that the dangers each way were so considerable they dared
not decide, though an honourable peace would be the greatest comfort they
could have, and concluded by hoping that the king would not engage to do
homage for Calais or the conquered
country.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
The parliament of the
tenth of his reign was expressly summoned in order to advise concerning
the king's intended expedition beyond sea&mdash;a great council, which had
previously been assembled at Oxford, having declared their incompetence to
consent to this measure without the advice of
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> Yet a few
years afterwards, on a similar reference, the commons rather declined to
give any opinion.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
They confirmed the league of Henry V. with the
emperor Sigismund;<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
and the treaty of Troyes, which was so
fundamentally to change the situation of Henry and his successors,
obtained, as it evidently required, the sanction of both houses of
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
These precedents conspiring with the weakness of the
executive government, in the minority of Henry VI., to fling an increase
of influence into the scale of the commons, they made their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> concurrence
necessary to all important business both of a foreign and domestic nature.
Thus commissioners were appointed to treat of the deliverance of the king
of Scots, the duchesses of Bedford and Gloucester were made denizens, and
mediators were appointed to reconcile the dukes of Gloucester and
Burgundy, by authority of the three estates assembled in
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Leave was given to the dukes of Bedford and Gloucester, and others in the
king's behalf, to treat of peace with France, by both houses of
parliament, in pursuance of an article in the treaty of Troyes, that no
treaty should be set on foot with the dauphin without consent of the three
estates of both
realms.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
This article was afterwards
repealed.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>Some complaints are made by the commons, even during the first years of
Henry's minority, that the king's subjects underwent arbitrary
imprisonment, and were vexed by summonses before the council and by the
newly-invented writ of subp&oelig;na out of
chancery.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
But these are not
so common as formerly; and so far as the rolls lead us to any inference,
there was less injustice committed by the government under Henry VI. and
his father than at any former period. Wastefulness indeed might justly be
imputed to the regency, who had scandalously lavished the king's
revenue.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
This ultimately led to an act for resuming all grants since
his accession, founded upon a public declaration of the great officers of
the crown that his debts amounted to 372,000<i>l.</i>, and the annual expense
of the household to 24,000<i>l.</i>, while the ordinary revenue was not more
than 5000<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Impeachments of ministers.</div>

<p>6. But before this time the sky had begun to darken, and discontent with
the actual administration pervaded every rank. The causes of this are
familiar&mdash;the unpopularity of the king's marriage with Margaret of Anjou,
and her impolitic violence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in the conduct of affairs, particularly the
imputed murder of the people's favourite, the duke of Gloucester. This
provoked an attack upon her own creature, the duke of Suffolk. Impeachment
had lain still, like a sword in the scabbard, since the accession of Henry
IV., when the commons, though not preferring formal articles of
accusation, had petitioned the king that Justice Rickhill, who had been
employed to take the former duke of Gloucester's confession at Calais, and
the lords appellants of Richard II.'s last parliament, should be put on
their defence before the
lords.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
In Suffolk's case the commons seem to
have proceeded by bill of attainder, or at least to have designed the
judgment against that minister to be the act of the whole legislature; for
they delivered a bill containing articles against him to the lords, with a
request that they would pray the king's majesty to enact that bill in
parliament, and that the said duke might be proceeded against upon the
said articles in parliament according to the law and custom of England.
These articles contained charges of high treason, chiefly relating to his
conduct in France, which, whether treasonable or not, seems to have been
grossly against the honour and advantage of the crown. At a later day the
commons presented many other articles of misdemeanor. To the former he
made a defence, in presence of the king as well as the lords both
spiritual and temporal; and indeed the articles of impeachment were
directly addressed to the king, which gave him a reasonable pretext to
interfere in the judgment. But from apprehension, as it is said, that
Suffolk could not escape conviction upon at least some part of these
charges, Henry anticipated with no slight irregularity the course of legal
trial, and, summoning the peers into a private chamber, informed the duke
of Suffolk, by mouth of his chancellor, that, inasmuch as he had not put
himself upon his peerage, but submitted wholly to the royal pleasure, the
king, acquitting him of the first articles containing matter of treason,
by his own advice and not that of the lords, nor by way of judgment, not
being in a place where judgment could be delivered, banished him for five
years from his dominions. The lords then present besought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> the king to let
their protest appear on record, that neither they nor their posterity
might lose their rights of peerage by this precedent. It was justly
considered as an arbitrary stretch of prerogative, in order to defeat the
privileges of parliament and screen a favourite minister from punishment.
But the course of proceeding by bill of attainder, instead of regular
impeachment, was not judiciously chosen by the
commons.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Privilege of parliament.</div>

<p>7. Privilege of parliament, an extensive and singular branch of our
constitutional law, begins to attract attention under the Lancastrian
princes. It is true indeed that we can trace long before by records, and
may infer with probability as to times whose records have not survived,
one considerable immunity&mdash;a freedom from arrest for persons transacting
the king's business in his national
council.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
Several authorities may
be found in Mr. Hatsell's Precedents; of which one, in the 9th of Edward
II., is conclusive.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
But in those rude times members of parliament
were not always respected by the officers executing legal process, and
still less by the violators of law. After several remonstrances, which the
crown had evaded,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
the commons obtained the statute 11 Henry VI. c.
11, for the punishment of such as assault any on their way to the
parliament, giving double damages to the
party.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> They had more
difficulty in establishing, notwithstanding the old precedents in their
favour, an immunity from all criminal process except in charges of
treason, felony, and breach of the peace, which is their present measure
of privilege. The truth was, that, with a right pretty clearly recognised,
as is admitted by the judges in Thorp's case, the house of commons had no
regular compulsory process at their command. In the cases of Lark, servant
of a member, in the 8th of Henry

it was thought necessary to effect their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
release from a civil execution by special acts of
parliament. The commons, in a former instance, endeavoured to make the law
general that no members nor their servants might be taken except for
treason, felony, and breach of peace; but the king put a negative upon
this part of their petition.</p>

<p>The most celebrated, however, of these early cases of privilege is that of
Thomas Thorp, speaker of the commons in 31 Henry VI. This person, who was
moreover a baron of the exchequer, had been imprisoned on an execution at
suit of the duke of York. The commons sent some of their members to
complain of a violation of privilege to the king and lords in parliament,
and to demand Thorp's release. It was alleged by the duke of York's
counsel that the trespass done by Thorp was since the beginning of the
parliament, and the judgment thereon given in time of vacation, and not
during the sitting. The lords referred the question to the judges, who
said, after deliberation, that "they ought not to answer to that question,
for it hath not be used aforetyme that the judges should in any wise
determine the privilege of this high court of parliament; for it is so
high and so mighty in his nature that it may make law, and that that is
law it may make no law; and the determination and knowledge of that
privilege belongeth to the lords of the parliament, and not to the
justices." They went on, however, after observing that a general writ of
supersedeas of all processes upon ground of privilege had not been known,
to say that, "if any person that is a member of this high court of
parliament be arrested in such cases as be not for treason, or felony, or
surety of the peace, or for a condemnation had before the parliament, it
is used that all such persons should be released of such arrests and make
an attorney, so that they may have their freedom and liberty freely to
intend upon the parliament."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this answer of the judges, it was concluded by the lords
that Thorp should remain in prison, without regarding the alleged
privilege; and the commons were directed in the king's name to proceed
"with all goodly haste and speed" to the election of a new speaker. It is
curious to observe that the commons, forgetting their grievances, or
content to drop them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
made such haste and speed according to this
command, that they presented a new speaker for approbation the next
day.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<p>This case, as has been strongly said, was begotten by the iniquity of the
times. The state was verging fast towards civil war; and Thorp, who
afterwards distinguished himself for the Lancastrian cause, was an
inveterate enemy of the duke of York. That prince seems to have been
swayed a little from his usual temper in procuring so unwarrantable a
determination. In the reign of Edward IV. the commons claimed privilege
against any civil suit during the time of their session; but they had
recourse, as before, to a particular act of parliament to obtain a writ of
supersedeas in favour of one Atwell, a member, who had been sued. The
present law of privilege seems not to have been fully established, or at
least effectually maintained, before the reign of Henry
VIII.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<p>No privilege of the commons can be so fundamental as liberty of speech.
This is claimed at the opening of every parliament by their speaker, and
could never be infringed without shaking the ramparts of the constitution.
Richard II.'s attack upon Haxey has been already mentioned as a flagrant
evidence of his despotic intentions. No other case occurs until the 33rd
year of Henry VI., when Thomas Young, member for Bristol, complained to
the commons, that, "for matters by him showed in the house accustomed for
the commons in the said parliaments, he was therefore taken, arrested, and
rigorously in open wise led to the Tower of London, and there grievously
in great duress long time imprisoned against the said freedom and
liberty;" with much more to the like effect. The commons transmitted this
petition to the lords, and the king "willed that the lords of his council
do and provide for the said suppliant as in their discretions shall be
thought convenient and reasonable." This imprisonment of Young, however,
had happened six years before, in consequence of a motion made by him
that, the king then having no issue, the duke of York might be declared
heir-apparent to the crown. In the present session, when the duke was
protector, he thought it well-timed to prefer his claim to
remuneration.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
There is a remarkable precedent in the 9th of Henry IV., and perhaps the
earliest authority for two eminent maxims of parliamentary law&mdash;that the
commons possess an exclusive right of originating money bills, and that
the king ought not to take notice of matters pending in parliament. A
quarrel broke out between the two houses upon this ground; and as we have
not before seen the commons venture to clash openly with their superiors,
the circumstance is for this additional reason worthy of attention. As it
has been little noticed, I shall translate the whole record.</p>

<p>"Friday the second day of December, which was the last day of the
parliament, the commons came before the king and the lords in parliament,
and there, by command of the king, a schedule of indemnity touching a
certain altercation moved between the lords and commons was read; and on
this it was commanded by our said lord the king that the said schedule
should be entered of record in the roll of parliament; of which schedule
the tenor is as follows: Be it remembered, that on Monday the 21st day of
November, the king our sovereign lord being in the council-chamber in the
abbey of Gloucester,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
the lords spiritual and temporal for this
present parliament assembled being then in his presence, a debate took
place among them about the state of the kingdom, and its defence to resist
the malice of the enemies who on every side prepare to molest the said
kingdom and its faithful subjects, and how no man can resist this malice,
unless, for the safeguard and defence of his said kingdom, our sovereign
lord the king has some notable aid and subsidy granted to him in his
present parliament. And therefore it was demanded of the said lords by way
of question what aid would be sufficient and requisite in these
circumstances? To which question it was answered by the said lords
severally, that, considering the necessity of the king on one side, and
the poverty of his people on the other, no less aid could be sufficient
than one tenth and a half from cities and towns, and one fifteenth and a
half from all other lay persons; and, besides, to grant a continuance of
the subsidy on wool, woolfells, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
leather, and of three shillings on
the tun (of wine), and twelve pence on the pound (of other merchandise),
from Michaelmas next ensuing for two years thenceforth. Whereupon, by
command of our said lord the king, a message was sent to the commons of
this parliament to cause a certain number of their body to come before our
said lord the king and the lords, in order to hear and report to their
companions what they should be commanded by our said lord the king. And
upon this the said commons sent into the presence of our said lord the
king and the said lords twelve of their companions; to whom, by command of
our said lord the king, the said question was declared, with the answer by
the said lords severally given to it. Which answer it was the pleasure of
our said lord the king that they should report to the rest of their
fellows, to the end that they might take the shortest course to comply
with the intention of the said lords. Which report being thus made to the
said commons, they were greatly disturbed at it, saying and asserting it
to be much to the prejudice and derogation of their liberties. And after
that our said lord the king had heard this, not willing that anything
should be done at present, or in time to come, that might anywise turn
against the liberty of the estate for which they are come to parliament,
nor against the liberties of the said lords, wills and grants and
declares, by the advice and consent of the said lords, as follows: to wit,
that it shall be lawful for the lords to debate together in this present
parliament, and in every other for time to come, in the king's absence,
concerning the condition of the kingdom, and the remedies necessary for
it. And in like manner it shall be lawful for the commons, on their part,
to debate together concerning the said condition and remedies. Provided
always that neither the lords on their part, nor the commons on theirs, do
make any report to our said lord the king of any grant granted by the
commons, and agreed to by the lords, nor of the communications of the said
grant, before that the said lords and commons are of one accord and
agreement in this matter, and then in manner and form accustomed&mdash;that is
to say, by the mouth of the speaker of the said commons for the time
being&mdash;to the end that the said lords and commons may have what they
desire (avoir puissent leur gree) of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
said lord the king. Our said
lord the king willing moreover, by the consent of the said lords, that the
communication had in this present parliament as above be not drawn into
precedent in time to come, nor be turned to the prejudice or derogation of
the liberty of the estate for which the said commons are now come, neither
in this present parliament nor in any other time to come. But wills that
himself and all the other estates should be as free as they were before.
Also, the said last day of parliament, the said speaker prayed our said
lord the king, on the part of the said commons, that he would grant the
said commons that they should depart in as great liberty as other commons
had done before. To which the king answered that this pleased him well,
and that at all times it had been his
desire."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>Every attentive reader will discover this remarkable passage to illustrate
several points of constitutional law. For hence it may be
perceived&mdash;first, that the king was used in those times to be present at
debates of the lords, personally advising with them upon the public
business; which also appears by many other passages on record; and this
practice, I conceive, is not abolished by the king's present declaration,
save as to grants of money, which ought to be of the free will of
parliament, and without that fear or influence which the presence of so
high a person might create: secondly, that it was already the established
law of parliament that the lords should consent to the commons' grant, and
not the commons to the lords'; since it is the inversion of this order
whereof the commons complain, and it is said expressly that grants are
made by the commons, and agreed to by the lords: thirdly, that the lower
house of parliament is not, in proper language, an estate of the realm,
but rather the image and representative of the commons of England; who,
being the third estate, with the nobility and clergy make up and
constitute the people of this kingdom and liege subjects of the
crown.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
At the next meeting of parliament, in allusion probably to this
disagreement between the houses, the king told them that the states of
parliament were come together for the common profit of the king and
kingdom, and for unanimity's sake and general consent; and therefore he
was sure the commons would not attempt nor say anything but what should be
fitting and conducive to unanimity; commanding them to meet together and
communicate for the public
service.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p>It was not only in money bills that the originating power was supposed to
reside in the commons. The course of proceedings in parliament, as has
been seen, from the commencement at least of Edward III.'s reign,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> was
that the commons presented petitions, which the lords, by themselves, or
with the assistance of the council, having duly considered, the sanction
of the king was notified or withheld. This was so much according to usage,
that, on one occasion, when the commons requested the advice of the other
house on a matter before them, it was answered that the ancient custom and
form of parliament had ever been for the commons to report their own
opinion to the king and lords, and not to the contrary; and the king would
have the ancient and laudable usages of parliament
maintained.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> It is
singular that in the terror of innovation the lords did not discover how
materially this usage of parliament took off from their own legislative
influence. The rule, however, was not observed in succeeding times; bills
originated indiscriminately in either house; and indeed some acts of Henry
V., which do not appear to be grounded on any petition, may be suspected,
from the manner of their insertion in the rolls of parliament, to have
been proposed on the king's part to the
commons.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> But there is one
manifest instance in the 18th of Henry VI., where the king requested the
commons to give their authority to such
regulations<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> his council
might provide for redressing the abuse of purveyance; to which they
assented.</p>

<p>If we are to choose constitutional precedents from seasons of tranquillity
rather than disturbance, which surely is the only means of preserving
justice or consistency, but little intrinsic authority can be given to the
following declaration of parliamentary law in the 11th of Richard II.: "In
this parliament (the roll says) all the lords as well spiritual and
temporal there present claimed as their liberty and privilege, that the
great matters moved in this parliament, and to be moved in other
parliaments for time to come, touching the peers of the land, should be
treated, adjudged, and debated according to the course of parliament, and
not by the civil law nor the common law of the land, used in the other
lower courts of the kingdom; which claim, liberty, and privileges, the
king graciously allowed and granted them in full
parliament."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> It
should be remembered that this assertion of paramount privilege was made
in very irregular times, when the king was at the mercy of the duke of
Gloucester and his associates, and that it had a view to the immediate
object of justifying their violent proceedings against the opposite party,
and taking away the restraint of the common law. It stands as a dangerous
rock to be avoided, not a lighthouse to guide us along the channel. The
law of parliament, as determined by regular custom, is incorporated into
our constitution; but not so as to warrant an indefinite, uncontrollable
assumption of power in any case, least of all in judicial procedure, where
the form and the essence of justice are inseparable from each other. And,
in fact, this claim of the lords, whatever gloss Sir E. Coke may put upon
it, was never intended to bear any relation to the privileges of the lower
house. I should not, perhaps, have noticed this passage so strongly if it had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
been made the basis of extravagant assertions as to the
privileges of parliament;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
the spirit of which exaggerations might not
be ill adapted to the times wherein Sir E. Coke lived, though I think they
produced at several later periods no slight mischief, some consequences of
which we may still have to experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contested elections how determined.</div>

<p>The want of all judicial authority, either to issue process or to examine
witnesses, together with the usual shortness of sessions, deprived the
house of commons of what is now considered one of its most fundamental
privileges, the cognizance of disputed elections. Upon a false return by
the sheriff, there was no remedy but through the king or his council. Six
instances only, I believe, occur, during the reigns of the Plantagenet
family, wherein the misconduct or mistake of the sheriff is recorded to
have called for a specific animadversion, though it was frequently the
ground of general complaint, and even of some statutes. The first is in
the 12th of Edward II., when a petition was presented to the council
against a false return for the county of Devon, the petitioner having been
duly elected. It was referred to the court of exchequer to summon the
sheriff before them.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
The next occurs in the 36th of Edward III., when
a writ was directed to the sheriff of Lancashire, after the dissolution of
parliament, to inquire at the county-court into the validity of the
election; and upon his neglect a second writ issued to the justices of the
peace to satisfy themselves about this in the best manner they could, and
report the truth into chancery. This inquiry after the dissolution was on
account of the wages for attendance, to which the knights unduly returned
could have no pretence.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
We find a third case in the 7th of Richard
II., when the king took notice that Thomas de Camoys, who was summoned by
writ to the house of peers, had been elected knight for Surrey, and
directed the sheriff to return
another.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
In the same year the town of
Shaftesbury petitioned the king, lords, and commons against a false return
of the sheriff of Dorset, and prayed them to order remedy. Nothing further
appears respecting this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
petition.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
This is the first instance of the
commons being noticed in matters of election. But the next case is more
material; in the 5th of Henry IV. the commons prayed the king and lords in
parliament, that, because the writ of summons to parliament was not
sufficiently returned by the sheriff of Rutland, this matter might be
examined in parliament, and in case of default found therein an exemplary
punishment might be inflicted; whereupon the lords sent for the sheriff
and Oneby, the knight returned, as well as for Thorp, who had been duly
elected, and, having examined into the facts of the case, directed the
return to be amended, by the insertion of Thorp's name, and committed the
sheriff to the Fleet till he should pay a fine at the king's
pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
The last passage that I can produce is from the roll of 18
H. VI., where "it is considered by the king, with the advice and assent of
the lords spiritual and temporal," that, whereas no knights have been
returned for Cambridgeshire, the sheriff shall be directed, by another
writ, to hold a court and to proceed to an election, proclaiming that no
person shall come armed, nor any tumultuous proceeding take place;
something of which sort appears to have obstructed the execution of the
first writ. It is to be noticed that the commons are not so much as named
in this entry.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
But several provisions were made by statute under the
Lancastrian kings, when seats in parliament became much more an object of
competition than before, to check the partiality of the sheriffs in making
undue returns. One act (11 H. IV. c. 1) gives the justices of assise power
to inquire into this matter, and inflicts a penalty of one hundred pounds
on the sheriff. Another (6 H. VI. c. 4) mitigates the rigour of the
former, so far as to permit the sheriff or the knights returned by him to
traverse the inquests before the justices; that is, to be heard in their
own defence, which, it seems, had not been permitted to them. Another (23
H. VI. c. 14) gives an additional penalty upon false returns to the party
aggrieved. These statutes conspire with many other testimonies to manifest
the rising importance of the house of commons, and the eagerness with
which gentlemen of landed estates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
(whatever might be the case in petty
boroughs) sought for a share in the national representation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In whom the right of voting for knights resided.</div>

<p>Whoever may have been the original voters for county representatives, the
first statute that regulates their election, so far from limiting the
privilege to tenants in capite, appears to place it upon a very large and
democratical foundation. For (as I rather conceive, though not without
much hesitation), not only all freeholders, but all persons whatever
present at the county-court, were declared, or rendered, capable of voting
for the knight of their shire. Such at least seems to be the inference
from the expressions of 7 H. IV. c. 15, "all who are there present, as
well suitors duly summoned for that cause as
others."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> And this
acquires some degree of confirmation from the later statute, 8 H. VI. c.
7, which, reciting that "elections of knights of shires have now of late
been made by very great, outrageous, and excessive number of people
dwelling within the same counties, of the which most part was people of
small substance and of no value," confines the elective franchise to
freeholders of lands or tenements to the value of forty shillings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elections of burgesses.</div>

<p>The representation of towns in parliament was founded upon two
principles&mdash;of consent to public burthens, and of advice in public measures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
especially such as related to trade and shipping. Upon both
these accounts it was natural for the kings who first summoned them to
parliament, little foreseeing that such half-emancipated burghers would
ever clip the loftiest plumes of their prerogative, to make these
assemblies numerous, and summon members from every town of consideration
in the kingdom. Thus the writ of 23 E. I. directs the sheriffs to cause
deputies to be elected to a general council from every city, borough, and
trading town. And although the last words are omitted in subsequent writs,
yet their spirit was preserved; many towns having constantly returned
members to parliament by regular summonses, from the sheriffs, which were
no chartered boroughs, nor had apparently any other claim than their
populousness or commerce. These are now called boroughs by
prescription.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<p>Besides these respectable towns, there were some of a less eminent figure
which had writs directed to them as ancient demesnes of the crown. During
times of arbitrary taxation the crown had set tallages alike upon its
chartered boroughs and upon its tenants in demesne. When parliamentary
consent became indispensable, the free tenants in ancient demesne, or
rather such of them as inhabited some particular vills, were called to
parliament among the other representatives of the commons. They are
usually specified distinctly from the other classes of representatives in
grants of subsidies throughout the parliaments of the first and second Edwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
till, about the beginning of the third's reign, they were
confounded with ordinary
burgesses.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
This is the foundation of that
particular species of elective franchise incident to what we denominate
burgage tenure; which, however, is not confined to the ancient demesne of
the crown.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of the sheriff to omit boroughs.</div>

<p>The proper constituents therefore of the citizens and burgesses in
parliament appear to have been&mdash;1. All chartered boroughs, whether they
derived their privileges from the crown, or from a mesne lord, as several
in Cornwall did from Richard king of the
Romans;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> 2. All towns which
were the ancient or the actual demesne of the crown; 3. All considerable
places, though unincorporated, which could afford to defray the expenses
of their representatives, and had a notable interest in the public
welfare. But no parliament ever perfectly corresponded with this theory.
The writ was addressed in general terms to the sheriff, requiring him to
cause two knights to be elected out of the body of the county, two
citizens from every city, and two burgesses from every borough. It rested
altogether upon him to determine what towns should exercise this
franchise; and it is really incredible, with all the carelessness and
ignorance of those times, what frauds the sheriffs ventured to commit in
executing this trust. Though parliaments met almost every year, and there
could be no mistake in so notorious a fact, it was the continual practice
of sheriffs to omit boroughs that had been in recent habit of electing
members, and to return upon the writ that there were no more within their
county. Thus in the 12th of Edward III. the sheriff of Wiltshire, after
returning two citizens for Salisbury, and burgesses for two boroughs,
concludes with these words:&mdash;"There are no other cities or boroughs within
my bailiwick." Yet in fact eight other towns had sent members to preceding
parliaments. So in the 6th of Edward II. the sheriff of Bucks declared
that he had no borough within his county except Wycomb; though Wendover,
Agmondesham, and Marlow had twice made returns since that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> king's
accession.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
And from this cause alone it has happened that many towns
called boroughs, and having a charter and constitution as such, have never
returned members to parliament; some of which are now among the most
considerable in England, as Leeds, Birmingham, and
Macclesfield.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested, indeed, by
Brady,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
that these returns may not
appear so false and collusive if we suppose the sheriff to mean only that
there were no resident burgesses within these boroughs fit to be returned,
or that the expense of their wages would be too heavy for the place to
support. And no doubt the latter plea, whether implied or not in the
return, was very frequently an inducement to the sheriffs to spare the
smaller boroughs. The wages of knights were four shillings a day, levied
on all freeholders, or at least on all holding by knight-service, within
the county.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Those of burgesses were half that
sum;<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
but even this pittance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
was raised with reluctance and difficulty from miserable
burghers, little solicitous about political franchises. Poverty, indeed,
seems to have been accepted as a legal excuse. In the 6th of E. II. the
sheriff of Northumberland returns to the writ of summons that all his
knights are not sufficient to protect the county; and in the 1st of E.
III. that they were too much ravaged by their enemies to send any members
to parliament.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
The sheriffs of Lancashire, after several returns that
they had no boroughs within their county, though Wigan, Liverpool, and
Preston were such, alleged at length that none ought to be called upon on
account of their poverty. This return was constantly made, from 36 E. III.
to the reign of Henry
VI.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reluctance of boroughs to send members.</div>

<p>The elective franchise was deemed by the boroughs no privilege or
blessing, but rather, during the chief part of this period, an intolerable
grievance. Where they could not persuade the sheriff to omit sending his
writ to them, they set it at defiance by sending no return. And this
seldom failed to succeed, so that, after one or two refusals to comply,
which brought no punishment upon them, they were left in quiet enjoyment
of their insignificance. The town of Torrington, in Devonshire, went
further, and obtained a charter of exemption from sending burgesses,
grounded upon what the charter asserts to appear on the rolls of chancery,
that it had never been represented before the 21st of E. III. This is
absolutely false, and is a proof how little we can rely upon the veracity
of records, Torrington having made not less than twenty-two returns before
that time. It is curious that in spite of this charter the town sent
members to the two ensuing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
parliaments, and then ceased for
ever.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Richard II. gave the inhabitants of Colchester a dispensation from
returning burgesses for five years, in consideration of the expenses they
had incurred in fortifying the
town.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
But this immunity, from whatever
reason, was not regarded, Colchester having continued to make returns as
before.</p>

<p>The partiality of sheriffs in leaving out boroughs, which were accustomed
in old time to come to the parliament, was repressed, as far as law could
repress it, by a statute of Richard II., which imposed a fine on them for
such neglect, and upon any member of parliament who should absent himself
from his duty.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
But it is, I think, highly probable that a great part
of those who were elected from the boroughs did not trouble themselves
with attendance in parliament. The sheriff even found it necessary to take
sureties for their execution of so burthensome a duty, whose names it was
usual, down to the end of the fifteenth century, to endorse upon the writ
along with those of the
elected.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
This expedient is not likely to have
been very successful; and the small number, comparatively speaking, of
writs for expenses of members for boroughs, which have been published by
Prynne, while those for the knights of shires are almost complete, leads
to a strong presumption that their attendance was very defective. This
statute of Richard II. produced no sensible effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who the electors in boroughs were.</div>

<p>By what persons the election of burgesses was usually made is a question
of great obscurity, which is still occasionally debated before committees
of parliament. It appears to have been the common practice for a very few
of the principal members of the corporation to make the election in the
county-court, and their names, as actual electors, are generally returned
upon the writ by the
sheriff.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
But we cannot surely be warranted by
this to infer that they acted in any other capacity than as deputies of
the whole body, and indeed it is frequently expressed that they chose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
such and such persons by the assent of the
community;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> by which word,
in an ancient corporate borough, it seems natural to understand the
freemen participating in its general franchises, rather than the ruling
body, which, in many instances at present, and always perhaps in the
earliest age of corporations, derived its authority by delegation from the
rest. The consent, however, of the inferior freemen we may easily believe
to have been merely nominal; and, from being nominal, it would in many
places come by degrees not to be required at all; the corporation,
specially so denominated, or municipal government, acquiring by length of
usage an exclusive privilege in election of members of parliament, as they
did in local administration. This, at least, appears to me a more probable
hypothesis than that of Dr. Brady, who limits the original right of
election in all corporate boroughs to the aldermen or other capital
burgesses.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Members of the house of commons.</div>

<p>The members of the house of commons, from this occasional disuse of
ancient boroughs as well as from the creation of new ones, underwent some
fluctuation during the period subject to our review. Two hundred citizens
and burgesses sat in the parliament held by Edward I. in his twenty-third
year, the earliest epoch of acknowledged representation. But in the reigns
of Edward III. and his three successors about ninety places, on an
average, returned members, so that we may reckon this part of the commons at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
hundred and eighty.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
These, if regular in their duties, might
appear an over-balance for the seventy-four knights who sat with them. But
the dignity of ancient lineage, territorial wealth, and military
character, in times when the feudal spirit was hardly extinct and that of
chivalry at its height, made these burghers vail their heads to the landed
aristocracy. It is pretty manifest that the knights, though doubtless with
some support from the representatives of towns, sustained the chief brunt
of battle against the crown. The rule and intention of our old
constitution was, that each county, city, or borough, should elect
deputies out of its own body, resident among themselves, and consequently
acquainted with their necessities and
grievances.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
It would be very
interesting to discover at what time, and by what degrees, the practice of
election swerved from this strictness. But I have not been able to trace
many steps of the transition. The number of practising lawyers who sat in
parliament, of which there are several complaints, seems to afford an
inference that it had begun in the reign of Edward III. Besides several
petitions of the commons that none but knights or reputable squires should
be returned for shires, an ordinance was made in the forty-sixth of his
reign that no lawyer practising in the king's court, nor sheriff during
his shrievalty, be returned knight for a county; because these lawyers put
forward many petitions in the name of the commons which only concerned
their clients.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
This probably was truly alleged, as we may guess from
the vast number of proposals for changing the course of legal process
which fill the rolls during this reign. It is not to be doubted, however,
that many practising lawyers were men of landed estate in their respective
counties.</p>

<p>An act in the first year of Henry V. directs that none be chosen knights,
citizens, or burgesses, who are not resident within the place for which
they are returned on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the day of the date of the writ.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> This statute
apparently indicates a point of time when the deviation from the line of
law was frequent enough to attract notice, and yet not so established as
to pass for an unavoidable irregularity. It proceeded, however, from great
and general causes, which new laws, in this instance very fortunately, are
utterly incompetent to withstand. There cannot be a more apposite proof of
the inefficacy of human institutions to struggle against the steady course
of events than this unlucky statute of Henry V., which is almost a
solitary instance in the law of England wherein the principle of desuetude
has been avowedly set up against an unrepealed enactment. I am not aware,
at least, of any other, which not only the house of commons, but the court
of king's bench, has deemed itself at liberty to declare unfit to be
observed.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
Even at the time when it was enacted, the law had probably,
as such, very little effect. But still the plurality of elections were
made according to ancient usage, as well as statute, out of the
constituent body. The contrary instances were exceptions to the rule; but
exceptions increasing continually, till they subverted the rule itself.
Prynne has remarked that we chiefly find Cornish surnames among the
representatives of Cornwall, and those of northern families among the
returns from the North. Nor do the members for shires and towns seem to
have been much interchanged; the names of the former belonging to the most
ancient families, while those of the latter have a more plebeian
cast.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
In the reign of Edward IV., and not before, a very few of the
burgesses bear the addition of esquire in the returns, which became
universal in the middle of the succeeding
century.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Irregularity of elections.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the crown upon them.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Even county elections seem in general, at least in the fourteenth century,
to have been ill-attended and left to the influence of a few powerful and
active persons. A petitioner against an undue return in the 12th of Edward
II. complains that, whereas he had been chosen knight for Devon by Sir
William Martin, bishop of Exeter, with the consent of the county, yet the
sheriff had returned
another.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
In several indentures of a much later
date a few persons only seem to have been concerned in the election,
though the assent of the community be
expressed.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> These
irregularities, which it would be exceedingly erroneous to convert, with
Hume, into lawful customs, resulted from the abuses of the sheriff's
power, which, when parliament sat only for a few weeks with its hands full
of business, were almost sure to escape with impunity. They were sometimes
also countenanced, or rather instigated, by the crown, which, having
recovered in Edward II.'s reign the prerogative of naming the sheriffs,
surrendered by an act of his
father,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
filled that office with its
creatures, and constantly disregarded the statute forbidding their
continuance beyond a year. Without searching for every passage that might
illustrate the interference of the crown in elections, I will mention two
or three leading instances. When Richard II. was meditating to overturn
the famous commission of reform, he sent for some of the sheriffs, and
required them to permit no knight or burgess to be elected to the next
parliament without the approbation of the king and his council. The
sheriffs replied that the commons would maintain their ancient privilege
of electing their own
representatives.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
The parliament of 1397, which
attainted his enemies and left the constitution at his mercy, was chosen,
as we are told, by dint of intimidation and
influence.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> Thus also that
of Henry VI., held at Coventry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in 1460, wherein the duke of York and his
party were attainted, is said to have been unduly returned by the like
means. This is rendered probable by a petition presented to it by the
sheriffs, praying indemnity for all which they had done in relation
thereto contrary to
law.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
An act passed according to their prayer, and
in confirmation of elections. A few years before, in 1455, a singular
letter under the king's signet is addressed to the sheriffs, reciting that
"we be enfourmed there is busy labour made in sondry wises by certaine
persons for the chesyng of the said knights, ... of which labour we
marvaille greatly, insomuche as it is nothing to the honour of the
laborers, but ayenst their worship; it is also ayenst the lawes of the
lande," with more to that effect; and enjoining the sheriff to let
elections be free and the peace
kept.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
There was certainly no reason
to wonder that a parliament, which was to shift the virtual sovereignty of
the kingdom into the hands of one whose claims were known to extend much
further, should be the object of tolerably warm contests. Thus in the
Paston letters we find several proofs of the importance attached to
parliamentary elections by the highest
nobility.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Constitution of the house of lords.</div>

<p>The house of lords, as we left it in the reign of Henry III., was entirely
composed of such persons holding lands by barony as were summoned by
particular writ of
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Tenure and summons were both essential
at this time in order to render any one a lord of parliament&mdash;the first by
the ancient constitution of our feudal monarchy from the Conquest, the
second by some regulation or usage of doubtful origin, which was
thoroughly established before the conclusion of Henry III.'s reign. This
produced, of course, a very marked difference between the greater and the
lesser or unparliamentary barons. The tenure of the latter, however, still
subsisted, and, though too inconsiderable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to be members of the
legislature, they paid relief as barons, they might be challenged on
juries, and, as I presume, by parity of reasoning, were entitled to trial
by their peerage. These lower barons, or more commonly tenants by parcels
of baronies,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
may be dimly traced to the latter years of Edward
III.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
But many of them were successively summoned to parliament, and
thus recovered the former lustre of their rank, while the rest fell
gradually into the station of commoners, as tenants by simple
knight-service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baronial tenure required for lords spiritual.</div>

<p>As tenure without summons did not entitle any one to the privileges of a
lord of parliament, so no spiritual person at least ought to have been
summoned without baronial tenure. The prior of St. James at Northampton,
having been summoned in the twelfth of Edward II., was discharged upon his
petition, because he held nothing of the king by barony, but only in
frankalmoign. The prior of Bridlington, after frequent summonses, was
finally left out, with an entry made in the roll that he held nothing of
the king. The abbot of Leicester had been called to fifty parliaments;
yet, in the 25th of Edward III., he obtained a charter of perpetual
exemption, reciting that he held no lands or tenements of the crown by
barony or any such service as bound him to attend parliaments or
councils.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
But great irregularities prevailed in the rolls of
chancery, from which the writs to spiritual and temporal peers were
taken&mdash;arising in part, perhaps, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
negligence, in part from wilful
perversion; so that many abbots and priors, who like these had no baronial
tenure, were summoned at times and subsequently omitted, of whose actual
exemption we have no record. Out of one hundred and twenty-two abbots and
forty-one priors who at some time or other sat in parliament, but
twenty-five of the former and two of the latter were constantly summoned:
the names of forty occur only once, and those of thirty-six others not,
more than five times.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
Their want of baronial tenure, in all
probability, prevented the repetition of writs which accident or occasion
had caused to issue.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Barons called by writ.</div>

<p>The ancient temporal peers are supposed to have been intermingled with
persons who held nothing of the crown by barony, but attended in
parliament solely by virtue of the king's prerogative exercised in the
writ of summons.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
These have been called barons by writ; and it seems
to be denied by no one that, at least under the first three Edwards, there
were some of this description in parliament. But after all the labours of
Dugdale and others in tracing the genealogies of our ancient aristocracy,
it is a problem of much difficulty to distinguish these from the
territorial barons. As the latter honours descended to female heirs, they
passed into new families and new names, so that we can hardly decide of
one summoned for the first time to parliament that he did not inherit the
possession of a feudal barony. Husbands of baronial heiresses were
frequently summoned in their wives' right, but by their own names.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> They
even sat after the death of their wives, as tenants by the
courtesy.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
Again, as lands, though not the subject of frequent transfer, were,
especially before the statute de donis, not inalienable, we cannot
positively assume that all the right heirs of original barons had
preserved those estates upon which their barony had
depended.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> If we
judge, however, by the lists of those summoned, according to the best
means in our power, it will appear, according at least to one of our most
learned investigators of this subject, that the regular barons by tenure
were all along very far more numerous than those called by writ; and that
from the end of Edward III.'s reign no spiritual persons, and few if any
laymen, except peers created by patent, were summoned to parliament who
did not hold territorial
baronies.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<p>With respect to those who were indebted for their seats among the lords to
the king's writ, there are two material questions: whether they acquired
an hereditary nobility by virtue of the writ; and, if this be determined
against them, whether they had a decisive or merely a deliberative voice
in the house. Now, for the first question, it seems that, if the writ of
summons conferred an estate of inheritance, it must have done so either by
virtue of its terms or by established construction and precedent. But the
writ contains no words by which such an estate can in law be limited; it
summons the person addressed to attend in parliament in order to give his
advice on the public business, but by no means implies that his advice
will be required of his heirs, or even of himself on any other occasion.
The strongest expression is "vobiscum et <i>c√¶teris</i> pr√¶latis, magnatibus et
proceribus," which appears to place the party on a sort of level with the
peers. But the words magnates and proceres are used very largely in
ancient language, and, down to the time of Edward III., comprehend the
king's ordinary council,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
as well as his barons. Nor can these, at any
rate, be construed to pass an inheritance, which in the grant of a private
person, much more of a king, would require express words of limitation. In
a single instance, the writ of summons to Sir Henry de Bromflete (27 H.
VI.), we find these remarkable words: Volumus enim vos et h√¶redes vestros
masculos de corpore vestro legitim√® exeuntes barones de Vescy existere.
But this Sir Henry de Bromflete was the lineal heir of the ancient barony
de Vesci.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
And if it were true that the writ of summons conveyed a
barony of itself, there seems no occasion to have introduced these
extraordinary words of creation or revival. Indeed there is less necessity
to urge these arguments from the nature of the writ, because the modern
doctrine, which is entirely opposite to what has here been suggested,
asserts that no one is ennobled by the mere summons unless he has rendered
it operative by taking his seat in parliament; distinguishing it in this
from a patent of peerage, which requires no act of the party for its
completion.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
But this distinction could be supported by nothing except
long usage. If, however, we recur to the practice of former times, we
shall find that no less than ninety-eight laymen were summoned once only
to parliament, none of their names occurring afterwards; and fifty others
two, three, or four times. Some were constantly summoned during their
lives, none of whose posterity ever attained that
honour.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> The course
of proceeding, therefore, previous to the accession of Henry VII., by no
means warrants the doctrine which was held in the latter end of
Elizabeth's reign,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
and has since been too fully established by
repeated precedents to be shaken by any reasoning. The foregoing observations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
relate to the more ancient history of our constitution, and
to the plain matter of fact as to those times, without considering what
political cause there might be to prevent the crown from introducing
occasional counsellors into the house of
lords.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bannerets summoned to house of lords.</div>

<p>It is manifest by many passages in these records that bannerets were
frequently summoned to the upper house of parliament, constituting a
distinct class inferior to barons, though generally named together, and
ultimately confounded, with
them.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
Barons are distinguished by the
appellation of Sire, bannerets have only that of Monsieur, as le Sire de
Berkeley, le Sire de Fitzwalter, Monsieur Richard Scrop, Monsieur Richard
Stafford. In the 7th of Richard II. Thomas Camoys having been elected
knight of the shire for Surrey, the king addresses a writ to the sheriff,
directing him to proceed to a new election, cum hujusmodi banneretti ante
h√¶c tempora in milites comitatus ratione alicujus parliamenti eligi minime
consueverunt. Camoys was summoned by writ to the same parliament. It has
been inferred from hence by Selden that he was a baron, and that the word
banneret is merely synonymous.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
But this is contradicted by too many
passages. Bannerets had so far been considered as commoners some years
before that they could not be challenged on
juries.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
But they seem to have been more highly estimated at the date of this writ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
The distinction, however, between barons and bannerets died away by
degrees. In the 2nd of Henry
VI.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Scrop of Bolton is called le Sire de
Scrop; a proof that he was then reckoned among the barons. The bannerets
do not often appear afterwards by that appellation as members of the upper
house. Bannerets, or, as they are called, banrents, are enumerated among
the orders of Scottish nobility in the year 1428, when the statute
directing the common lairds or tenants in capite to send representatives
was enacted; and a modern historian justly calls them an intermediate
order between the peers and
lairds.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
Perhaps a consideration of these
facts, which have frequently been overlooked, may tend in some measure to
explain the occasional discontinuance, or sometimes the entire cessation,
of writs of summons to an individual or his descendants; since we may
conceive that bannerets, being of a dignity much inferior to that of
barons, had no such inheritable nobility in their blood as rendered their
parliamentary privileges a matter of right. But whether all those who
without any baronial tenure received their writs of summons to parliament
belonged to the order of bannerets I cannot pretend to affirm; though some
passages in the rolls might rather lead to such a
supposition.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p>The second question relates to the right of suffrage possessed by these
temporary members of the upper house. It might seem plausible certainly to
conceive that the real and ancient aristocracy would not permit their
powers to be impaired by numbering the votes of such as the king might
please to send among them, however they might allow them to assist in
their debates. But I am much more inclined to suppose that they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> in
all respects on an equality with other peers during their actual
attendance in parliament. For,&mdash;1. They are summoned by the same writ as
the rest, and their names are confused among them in the lists; whereas
the judges and ordinary counsellors are called by a separate writ,
vobiscum et c√¶teris de consilio nostro, and their names are entered after
those of the peers.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
2. Some, who do not appear to have held
land-baronies, were constantly summoned from father to son, and thus
became hereditary lords of parliament through a sort of prescriptive
right, which probably was the foundation of extending the same privilege
afterwards to the descendants of all who had once been summoned. There is
no evidence that the family of Scrope, for example, which was eminent
under Edward III. and subsequent kings, and gave rise to two branches, the
lords of Bolton and Masham, inherited any territorial
honour.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> 3. It
is very difficult to obtain any direct proof as to the right of voting,
because the rolls of parliament do not take notice of any debates; but
there happens to exist one remarkable passage in which the suffrages of
the lords are individually specified. In the first parliament of Henry IV.
they were requested by the earl of Northumberland to declare what should
be done with the late king Richard. The lords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
then present agreed that he
should be detained in safe custody; and on account of the importance of
this matter it seems to have been thought necessary to enter their names
upon the roll in these words:&mdash;The names of the lords concurring in their
answer to the said question here follow; to wit, the archbishop of
Canterbury and fourteen other bishops; seven abbots; the prince of Wales,
the duke of York, and six earls; nineteen barons, styled thus&mdash;le Sire de
Roos, or le Sire de Grey de Ruthyn. Thus far the entry has nothing
singular; but then follow these nine names: Monsieur Henry Percy, Monsieur
Richard Scrop, le Sire Fitz-hugh, le Sire de Bergeveny, le Sire de Lomley,
le Baron de Greystock, le Baron de Hilton, Monsieur Thomas Erpyngham,
chamberlayn, Monsieur Mayhewe Gournay. Of these nine five were undoubtedly
barons, from whatever cause misplaced in order. Scrop was summoned by
writ; but his title of Monsieur, by which he is invariably denominated,
would of itself create a strong suspicion that he was no baron, and in
another place we find him reckoned among the bannerets. The other three do
not appear to have been summoned, their writs probably being lost. One of
them, Sir Thomas Erpyngham, a statesman well known in the history of those
times, is said to have been a
banneret;<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
certainly he was not a baron.
It is not unlikely that the two others, Henry Percy (Hotspur) and Gournay,
an officer of the household, were also bannerets; they cannot at least be
supposed to be barons, neither were they ever summoned to any subsequent
parliament. Yet in the only record we possess of votes actually given in
the house of lords they appear to have been reckoned among the
rest.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Creation of peers by statute.</div>

<p>The next method of conferring an honour of peerage was by creation in
parliament. This was adopted by Edward III. in several instances, though
always, I believe, for the higher titles of duke or earl. It is laid down
by lawyers that whatever the king is said in an ancient record to have
done in full parliament must be taken to have proceeded from the whole
legislature. As a question of fact, indeed, it might be doubted whether,
in many proceedings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
where this expression is used, and especially in the
creation of peers, the assent of the commons was specifically and
deliberately given. It seems hardly consonant to the circumstances of
their order under Edward III. to suppose their sanction necessary in what
seemed so little to concern their interest. Yet there is an instance in
the fortieth year of that prince where the lords individually, and the
commons with one voice, are declared to have consented, at the king's
request, that the lord de Coucy, who had married his daughter, and was
already possessed of estates in England, might be raised to the dignity of
an earl, whenever the king should determine what earldom he would confer
upon him.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
Under Richard II. the marquisate of Dublin is granted to
Vere by full consent of all the estates. But this instrument, besides the
unusual name of dignity, contained an extensive jurisdiction and authority
over Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
In the same reign Lancaster was made duke of Guienne,
and the duke of York's son created earl of Rutland, to hold during his
father's life. The consent of the lords and commons is expressed in their
patents, and they are entered upon the roll of
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> Henry V.
created his brothers dukes of Bedford and Gloucester by request of the
lords and commons.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
But the patent of Sir John Cornwall, in the tenth
of Henry VI., declares him to be made lord Fanhope, "by consent of the
lords, in the presence of the three estates of parliament;" as if it were
designed to show that the commons had not a legislative voice in the
creation of peers.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">And by patent.</div>

<p>The mention I have made of creating peers by act of parliament has partly
anticipated the modern form of letters patent, with which the other was
nearly allied. The first instance of a barony conferred by patent was in
the tenth year of Richard II., when Sir John Holt, a judge of the Common
Pleas, was created lord Beauchamp of Kidderminster. Holt's patent,
however, passed while Richard was endeavouring to act in an arbitrary
manner; and in fact he never sat in parliament, having been attainted in
that of the next year by the name of Sir John Holt. In a number of
subsequent patents down to the reign of Henry VII.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> the assent of
parliament is expressed, though it frequently happens that no mention of
it occurs in the parliamentary roll. And in some instances the roll speaks
to the consent of parliament where the patent itself is
silent.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[o]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Clergy summoned to attend parliament.</div>

<p>It is now perhaps scarcely known by many persons not unversed in the
constitution of their country, that, besides the bishops and baronial
abbots, the inferior clergy were regularly summoned at every parliament.
In the writ of summons to a bishop he is still directed to cause the dean
of his cathedral church, the archdeacon of his diocese, with one proctor
from the chapter of the former, and two from the body of his clergy, to
attend with him at the place of meeting. This might, by an inobservant
reader, be confounded with the summons to the convocation, which is
composed of the same constituent parts, and, by modern usage, is made to
assemble on the same day. But it may easily be distinguished by this
difference&mdash;that the convocation is provincial, and summoned by the
metropolitans of Canterbury and York; whereas the clause commonly
denominated pr√¶munientes (from its first word) in the writ to each bishop
proceeds from the crown, and enjoins the attendance of the clergy at the
national council of
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<p>The first unequivocal instance of representatives appearing for the lower
clergy is in the year 1255, when they are expressly named by the author of
the Annals of Burton.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
They preceded, therefore, by a few years the
house of commons; but the introduction of each was founded upon the same
principle. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
king required the clergy's money, but dared not take it
without their consent.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
In the double parliament, if so we may call
it, summoned in the eleventh of Edward I. to meet at Northampton and York,
and divided according to the two ecclesiastical provinces, the proctors of
chapters for each province, but not those of the diocesan clergy, were
summoned through a royal writ addressed to the archbishops. Upon account
of the absence of any deputies from the lower clergy these assemblies
refused to grant a subsidy. The proctors of both descriptions appear to
have been summoned by the pr√¶munientes clause in the 22nd, 23rd, 24th,
28th, and 35th years of the same king; but in some other parliaments of
his reign the pr√¶munientes clause is
omitted.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
The same irregularity
continued under his successor; and the constant usage of inserting this
clause in the bishop's writ is dated from the twenty-eighth of Edward
III.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p>It is highly probable that Edward I., whose legislative mind was engaged
in modelling the constitution on a comprehensive scheme, designed to
render the clergy an effective branch of parliament, however their
continual resistance may have defeated the accomplishment of this
intention.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
We find an entry upon the roll of his parliament at
Carlisle, containing a list of all the proctors deputed to it by the
several dioceses of the kingdom. This may be reckoned a clear proof of
their parliamentary attendance during his reign under the pr√¶munientes
clause; since the province of Canterbury could not have been present in
convocation at a city beyond its
limits.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
And indeed, if we were to
found our judgment merely on the language used in these writs, it would be
hard to resist a very strange paradox, that the clergy were not only one
of the three estates of the realm, but as essential a member of the
legislature by their representatives as the
commons.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
They are summoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
in the earliest year extant (23 E. I.) ad tractandum, ordinandum
et faciendum nobiscum, et cum c√¶teris pr√¶latis, proceribus, ac aliis
incolis regni nostri; in that of the next year, ad ordinandum de
quantitate et modo subsidii; in that of the twenty-eighth, ad faciendum et
consentiendum his, qu√¶ tunc de communi consilio ordinari contigerit. In
later times it ran sometimes ad faciendum et consentiendum, sometimes only
ad consentiendum; which, from the fifth of Richard II., has been the term
invariably adopted.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
Now, as it is usual to infer from the same words,
when introduced into the writs for election of the commons, that they
possessed an enacting power, implied in the words ad faciendum, or at
least to deduce the necessity of their assent from the words ad
consentiendum, it should seem to follow that the clergy were invested, as
a branch of the parliament, with rights no less extensive. It is to be
considered how we can reconcile these apparent attributes of political
power with the unquestionable facts that almost all laws, even while they
continued to attend, were passed without their concurrence, and that,
after some time, they ceased altogether to comply with the
writ.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>The solution of this difficulty can only be found in that estrangement
from the common law and the temporal courts which the clergy throughout
Europe were disposed to effect. In this country their ambition defeated
its own ends; and while they endeavoured by privileges and immunities to
separate themselves from the people, they did not perceive that the line
of demarcation thus strongly traced would cut them off from the sympathy
of common interests. Everything which they could call of ecclesiastical
cognizance was drawn into their own courts; while the administration of what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
they contemned as a barbarous system, the temporal law of the land,
fell into the hands of lay judges. But these were men not less subtle, not
less ambitious, not less attached to their profession than themselves; and
wielding, as they did in the courts of Westminster, the delegated sceptre
of judicial sovereignty, they soon began to control the spiritual
jurisdiction, and to establish the inherent supremacy of the common law.
From this time an inveterate animosity subsisted between the two courts,
the vestiges of which have only been effaced by the liberal wisdom of
modern ages. The general love of the common law, however, with the great
weight of its professors in the king's council and in parliament, kept the
clergy in surprising subjection. None of our kings after Henry III. were
bigots; and the constant tone of the commons serves to show that the
English nation was thoroughly averse to ecclesiastical influence, whether
of their own church or the see of Rome.</p>

<p>It was natural, therefore, to withstand the interference of the clergy
summoned to parliament in legislation, as much as that of the spiritual
court in temporal jurisdiction. With the ordinary subjects, indeed, of
legislation they had little concern. The oppressions of the king's
purveyors, or escheators, or officers of the forests, the abuses or
defects of the common law, the regulations necessary for trading towns and
seaports, were matters that touched them not, and to which their consent
was never required. And, as they well knew there was no design in
summoning their attendance but to obtain money, it was with great
reluctance that they obeyed the royal writ, which was generally obliged to
be enforced by an archiepiscopal
mandate.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
Thus, instead of an
assembly of deputies from an estate of the realm, they became a synod or
convocation. And it seems probable that in most, if not all, instances
where the clergy are said in the roll of parliament to have presented
their petitions, or are otherwise mentioned as a deliberative body, we
should suppose the convocation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
alone of the province of Canterbury to be
intended.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
For that of York seems to have been always considered as
inferior, and even ancillary, to the greater province, voting subsidies,
and even assenting to canons, without deliberation, in compliance with the example of
Canterbury;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
the convocation of which province consequently
assumed the importance of a national council. But in either point of view
the proceedings of this ecclesiastical assembly, collateral in a certain
sense to parliament, yet very intimately connected with it, whether
sitting by virtue of the pr√¶munientes clause or otherwise, deserve some
notice in a constitutional history.</p>

<p>In the sixth year of Edward III. the proctors of the clergy are specially
mentioned as present at the speech pronounced by the king's commissioner,
and retired, along with the prelates, to consult together upon the
business submitted to their deliberation. They proposed accordingly a
sentence of excommunication against disturbers of the peace, which was
assented to by the lords and commons. The clergy are said afterwards to
have had leave, as well as the knights, citizens, and burgesses, to return
to their homes; the prelates and peers continuing with the
king.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> This
appearance of the clergy in full parliament is not, perhaps, so decisively
proved by any later record. But in the eighteenth of the same reign
several petitions of the clergy are granted by the king and his council,
entered on the roll of parliament, and even the statute roll, and in some
respects are still part of our
law.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
To these it seems highly probable
that the commons gave no assent; and they may be reckoned among the other
infringements of their legislative rights. It is remarkable that in the
same parliament the commons, as if apprehensive of what was in
preparation, besought the king that no petition of the clergy might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> be
granted till he and his council should have considered whether it would
turn to the prejudice of the lords or
commons.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>A series of petitions from the clergy, in the twenty-fifth of Edward.
III., had not probably any real assent of the commons, though it is once
mentioned in the enacting words, when they were drawn into a
statute.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
Indeed the petitions correspond so little with the general sentiment of
hostility towards ecclesiastical privileges manifested by the lower house
of parliament, that they would not easily have obtained its acquiescence.
The convocation of the province of Canterbury presented several petitions
in the fiftieth year of the same king, to which they received an assenting
answer; but they are not found in the statute-book. This, however,
produced the following remonstrance from the commons at the next
parliament: "Also the commons beseech their lord the king, that no statute
nor ordinance be made at the petition of the clergy, unless by assent of
your commons; and that your commons be not bound by any constitutions
which they make for their own profit without the commons' assent. For they
will not be bound by any of your statutes or ordinances made without their
assent."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
The king evaded a direct answer to this petition. But the
province of Canterbury did not the less present their own grievances to
the king in that parliament, and two among the statutes of the year seem
to be founded upon no other
authority.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<p>In the first session of Richard II. the prelates and clergy of both
provinces are said to have presented their schedule of petitions which
appear upon the roll, and three of which are the foundation of statutes
unassented to in all probability by the
commons.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> If the clergy of
both provinces were actually present, as is here asserted, it must of
course have been as a house of parliament, and not of convocation. It
rather seems, so far as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
can trust to the phraseology of records, that
the clergy sat also in a national assembly under the king's writ in the
second year of the same
king.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
Upon other occasions during the same
reign, where the representatives of the clergy are alluded to as a
deliberative body, sitting at the same time with the parliament, it is
impossible to ascertain its constitution; and, indeed, even from those
already cited we cannot draw any positive
inference.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> But whether in
convocation or in parliament, they certainly formed a legislative council
in ecclesiastical matters by the advice and consent of which alone,
without that of the commons (I can say nothing as to the lords), Edward
III. and even Richard II. enacted laws to bind the laity. I have mentioned
in a different place a still more conspicuous instance of this assumed
prerogative; namely, the memorable statute against heresy in the second of
Henry IV.; which can hardly be deemed anything else than an infringement
of the rights of parliament, more clearly established at that time than at
the accession of Richard II. Petitions of the commons relative to
spiritual matters, however frequently proposed, in few or no instances
obtained the king's assent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
so as to pass into statutes, unless approved
by the convocation.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
But, on the other hand, scarcely any temporal
laws appear to have passed by the concurrence of the clergy. Two instances
only, so far as I know, are on record: the parliament held in the eleventh
of Richard II. is annulled by that in the twenty-first of his reign, "with
the assent of the lords spiritual and temporal, <i>and the proctors of the
clergy</i>, and the commons;"<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
and the statute entailing the crown on the
children of Henry IV. is said to be enacted on the petition of the
prelates, nobles, clergy, and
commons.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
Both these were stronger
exertions of legislative authority than ordinary acts of parliament, and
were very likely to be questioned in succeeding times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jurisdiction of the king's council.</div>

<p>The supreme judicature, which had been exercised by the king's court, was
diverted, about the reign of John, into three channels; the tribunals of
King's Bench, Common Pleas, and the
Exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
These became the
regular fountains of justice, which soon almost absorbed the provincial
jurisdictions of the sheriff and lord of manor. But the original
institution, having been designed for ends of state, police, and revenue,
full as much as for the determination of private suits, still preserved
the most eminent parts of its authority. For the king's ordinary or privy
council, which is the usual style from the reign of Edward I., seems to
have been no other than the king's court (curia regis) of older times,
being composed of the same persons, and having, in a principal degree, the
same subjects of deliberation. It consisted of the chief ministers; as the
chancellor, treasurer, lord steward, lord admiral, lord marshal, the
keeper of the privy seal, the chamberlain, treasurer, and comptroller of
the household, the chancellor of the exchequer, the master of the
wardrobe; and of the judges, king's serjeant, and attorney-general, the
master of the rolls, and justices in eyre, who at that time were not the
same as the judges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
at Westminster. When all these were called together,
it was a full council; but where the business was of a more contracted
nature, those only who were fittest to advise were summoned; the
chancellor and judges for matters of law; the officers of state for what
concerned the revenue or
household.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p>The business of this council, out of parliament, may be reduced to two
heads; its deliberative office as a council of advice, and its decisive
power of jurisdiction. With respect to the first, it obviously
comprehended all subjects of political deliberation, which were usually
referred to it by the king: this being in fact the administration or
governing council of state, the distinction of a cabinet being introduced
in comparatively modern times. But there were likewise a vast number of
petitions continually presented to the council, upon which they proceeded
no further than to sort, as it were, and forward them by endorsement to
the proper courts, or advise the suitor what remedy he had to seek. Thus
some petitions are answered, "this cannot be done without a new law;" some
were turned over to the regular court, as the chancery or king's bench;
some of greater moment were endorsed to be heard "before the great
council;" some, concerning the king's interest, were referred to the
chancery, or select persons of the council.</p>

<p>The coercive authority exercised by this standing council of the king was
far more important. It may be divided into acts, legislative and judicial.
As for the first, many ordinances were made in council; sometimes upon
request of the commons in parliament, who felt themselves better qualified
to state a grievance than a remedy; sometimes without any pretence, unless
the usage of government, in the infancy of our constitution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> may be
thought to afford one. These were always of a temporary or partial nature,
and were considered as regulations not sufficiently important to demand a
new statute. Thus, in the second year of Richard II., the council, after
hearing read the statute-roll of an act recently passed, confirming a
criminal jurisdiction in certain cases upon justices of the peace,
declared that the intention of parliament, though not clearly expressed
therein, had been to extend that jurisdiction to certain other cases
omitted, which accordingly they cause to be inserted in the commissions
made to these justices under the great
seal.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
But they frequently so
much exceeded what the growing spirit of public liberty would permit, that
it gave rise to complaint in parliament. The commons petition in 13 R. II.
that "neither the chancellor nor the king's council, after the close of
parliament, may make any ordinance against the common law, or the ancient
customs of the land, or the statutes made heretofore or to be made in this
parliament; but that the common law have its course for all the people,
and no judgment be rendered without due legal process." The king answers,
"Let it be done as has been usual heretofore, saving the prerogative; and
if any one is aggrieved, let him show it specially, and right shall be
done him."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
This unsatisfactory answer proves the arbitrary spirit in
which Richard was determined to govern.</p>

<p>The judicial power of the council was in some instances founded upon
particular acts of parliament, giving it power to hear and determine
certain causes. Many petitions likewise were referred to it from
parliament, especially where they were left unanswered by reason of a
dissolution. But, independently of this delegated authority, it is certain
that the king's council did anciently exercise, as well out of parliament
as in it, a very great jurisdiction, both in causes criminal and civil.
Some, however, have contended, that whatever they did in this respect was
illegal, and an encroachment upon the common law and Magna Charta. And be
the common law what it may, it seems an indisputable violation of the
charter in its most admirable and essential article, to drag men in
questions of their freehold or liberty before a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
tribunal which neither
granted them a trial by their peers nor always respected the law of the
land. Against this usurpation the patriots of those times never ceased to
lift their voices. A statute of the fifth year of Edward III. provides
that no man shall be attached, nor his property seized into the king's
hands, against the form of the great charter and the law of the land. In
the twenty-fifth of the same king it was enacted, that "none shall be
taken by petition or suggestion to the king or his council, unless it be
by indictment or presentment, or by writ original at the common law, nor
shall be put out of his franchise or freehold, unless he be duly put to
answer, and forejudged of the same by due course of
law."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> This was
repeated in a short act of the twenty-eighth of his
reign;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> but both,
in all probability, were treated with neglect; for another was passed some
years afterwards, providing that no man shall be put to answer without
presentment before justices, or matter of record, or by due process and
writ original according to the old law of the land. The answer to the
petition whereon this statute is grounded, in the parliament-roll,
expressly declares this to be an article of the great
charter.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Nothing, however, would prevail on the council to surrender so eminent a
power, and, though usurped, yet of so long a continuance. Cases of
arbitrary imprisonment frequently occurred, and were remonstrated against
by the commons. The right of every freeman in that cardinal point was as
undubitable, legally speaking, as at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
this day; but the courts of law were
afraid to exercise their remedial functions in defiance of so powerful a
tribunal. After the accession of the Lancastrian family, these, like other
grievances, became rather less frequent but the commons remonstrate
several times, even in the minority of Henry VI., against the council's
interference in matters cognizable at common
law.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> In these later
times the civil jurisdiction of the council was principally exercised in
conjunction with the chancery, and accordingly they are generally named
together in the complaint. The chancellor having the great seal in his
custody, the council usually borrowed its process from his court. This was
returnable into chancery even where the business was depending before the
council. Nor were the two jurisdictions less intimately allied in their
character, each being of an equitable nature; and equity, as then
practised, being little else than innovation and encroachment on the
course of law. This part, long since the most important of the
chancellor's judicial function, cannot be traced beyond the time of
Richard II., when, the practice of feoffments to uses having been
introduced, without any legal remedy to secure the cestui que use, or
usufructuary, against his feoffees, the court of chancery undertook to
enforce this species of contract by process of its
own.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p>Such was the nature of the king's ordinary council in itself, as the organ
of his executive sovereignty, and such the jurisdiction which it
habitually exercised. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
it is also to be considered in its relation to
the parliament, during whose session, either singly or in conjunction with
the lords' house, it was particularly conspicuous. The great officers of
state, whether peers or not, the judges, the king's serjeant, and
attorney-general, were, from the earliest times, as the latter still
continue to be, summoned by special writs to the upper house. But while
the writ of a peer runs ad tractandum nobiscum et cum c√¶teris pr√¶latis,
magnatibus et proceribus, that directed to one of the judges is only ad
tractandum nobiscum et cum c√¶teris de consilio nostro; and the seats of
the latter are upon the woolsacks at one extremity of the house.</p>

<p>In the reigns of Edward I. and II. the council appear to have been the
regular advisers of the king in passing laws to which the houses of
parliament had assented. The preambles of most statutes during this period
express their concurrence. Thus the statute Westm. I. is said to be the
act of the king by his council, and by the assent of archbishops, bishops,
abbots, priors, earls, barons, and all the commonalty of the realm being
hither summoned. The statute of escheators, 29 E. I., is said to be agreed
by the council, enumerating their names, all whom appear to be judges or
public officers. Still more striking conclusions are to be drawn from the
petitions addressed to the council by both houses of parliament. In the
eighth of Edward II. there are four petitions from the commons to the king
and his council, one from the lords alone, and one in which both appear to
have joined. Later parliaments of the same reign present us with several
more instances of the like nature. Thus in 18 E. II. a petition begins,
"To our lord the king, and to his council, the archbishops, bishops,
prelates, earls, barons, and others of the commonalty of England, show,"
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>But from the beginning of Edward III.'s reign it seems that the council
and the lords' house in parliament were often blended together into one
assembly. This was denominated the great council, being the lords
spiritual and temporal, with the king's ordinary council annexed to them,
as a council within a council. And even in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
much earlier times the lords,
as hereditary counsellors, were, either whenever they thought fit to
attend, or on special summonses by the king (it is hard to say which),
assistant members of this council, both for advice and for jurisdiction.
This double capacity of the peerage, as members of the parliament or
legislative assembly and of the deliberative and judicial council, throws
a very great obscurity over the subject. However, we find that private
petitions for redress were, even under Edward I., presented to the lords
in parliament as much as to the ordinary council. The parliament was
considered a high court of justice, where relief was to be given in cases
where the course of law was obstructed, as well as where it was defective.
Hence the intermission of parliaments was looked upon as a delay of
justice, and their annual meeting is demanded upon that ground. "The
king," says Fleta, "has his court in his council, in his parliaments, in
the presence of bishops, earls, barons, lords, and other wise men, where
the doubtful cases of judgments are resolved, and new remedies are
provided against new injuries, and justice is rendered to every man
according to his desert."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
In the third year of Edward II. receivers
of petitions began to be appointed at the opening of every parliament, who
usually transmitted them to the ordinary, but in some instances to the
great council. These receivers were commonly three for England, and three
for Ireland, Wales, Gascony, and other foreign dominions. There were
likewise two corresponding classes of auditors or triers of petitions.
These consisted partly of bishops or peers, partly of judges and other
members of the council; and they seem to have been instituted in order to
disburthen the council by giving answers to some petitions. But about the
middle of Edward III.'s time they ceased to act juridically in this
respect, and confined themselves to transmitting petitions to the lords of
the council.</p>

<p>The great council, according to the definition we have given, consisting
of the lords spiritual and temporal, in conjunction with the ordinary
council, or, in other words, of all who were severally summoned to
parliament, exercised a considerable jurisdiction, as well civil as
criminal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
In this jurisdiction it is the opinion of Sir M. Hale that the
council, though not peers, had right of suffrage; an opinion very
probable, when we recollect that the council by themselves, both in and
out of parliament, possessed in fact a judicial authority little inferior;
and that the king's delegated sovereignty in the administration of
justice, rather than any intrinsic right of the peerage, is the foundation
on which the judicature of the lords must be supported. But in the time of
Edward III. or Richard II. the lords, by their ascendency, threw the
judges and rest of the council into shade, and took the decisive
jurisdiction entirely to themselves, making use of their former colleagues
but as assistants and advisers, as they still continue to be held in all
the judicial proceedings of that
house.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

<p>Those statutes which restrain the king's ordinary council from disturbing
men in their freehold rights, or questioning them for misdemeanours, have
an equal application to the lords' house in parliament, though we do not
frequently meet with complaints of the encroachments made by that
assembly. There was, however, one class of cases tacitly excluded from the
operation of those acts, in which the coercive jurisdiction of this high
tribunal had great convenience; namely, where the ordinary course of
justice was so much obstructed by the defending party, through riots,
combinations of maintenance, or overawing influence, that no inferior
court would find its process obeyed. Those ages, disfigured in their
quietest season by rapine and oppression, afforded no small number of
cases that called for this interposition of a paramount
authority.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
Another indubitable
branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of this jurisdiction was in writs of error;
but it may be observed that their determination was very frequently left
to a select committee of peers and councillors. These, too, cease almost
entirely with Henry IV.; and were scarcely revived till the accession of
James I.</p>

<p>Some instances occur in the reign of Edward III. where records have been
brought into parliament, and annulled with assent of the commons as well
as the rest of the
legislature.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
But these were attainders of treason,
which it seemed gracious and solemn to reverse in the most authentic
manner. Certainly the commons had neither by the nature of our
constitution nor the practice of parliament any right of intermeddling in
judicature, save where something was required beyond the existing law, or
where, as in the statute of treasons, an authority of that kind was
particularly reserved to both houses. This is fully acknowledged by
themselves in the first year of Henry
IV.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
But their influence upon the balance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of government became so commanding in a few years afterwards,
that they contrived, as has been mentioned already, to have petitions
directed to them, rather than to the lords or council, and to transmit
them, either with a tacit approbation or in the form of acts, to the upper
house. Perhaps this encroachment of the commons may have contributed to
the disuse of the lords' jurisdiction, who would rather relinquish their
ancient and honourable but laborious function than share it with such bold
usurpers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General character of the government in these ages.</div>

<p>Although the restraining hand of parliament was continually growing more
effectual, and the notions of legal right acquiring more precision, from
the time of Magna Charta to the civil wars under Henry VI., we may justly
say that the general tone of administration was not a little arbitrary.
The whole fabric of English liberty rose step by step, through much toil
and many sacrifices, each generation adding some new security to the work,
and trusting that posterity would perfect the labour as well as enjoy the
reward. A time, perhaps, was even then foreseen in the visions of generous
hope, by the brave knights of parliament and by the sober sages of
justice, when the proudest ministers of the crown should recoil from those
barriers which were then daily pushed aside with impunity.</p>

<p>There is a material distinction to be taken between the exercise of the
king's undeniable prerogative, however repugnant to our improved
principles of freedom, and the abuse or extension of it to oppressive
purposes. For we cannot fairly consider as part of our ancient
constitution what the parliament was perpetually remonstrating against,
and the statute-book is full of enactments to repress. Doubtless the
continual acquiescence of a nation in arbitrary government may ultimately
destroy all privileges of positive institution, and leave them to recover,
by such means as opportunity shall offer, the natural and imprescriptible
rights for which human societies were established. And this may perhaps be
the case at present with many European kingdoms. But it would be necessary
to shut our eyes with deliberate prejudice against the whole tenor of the
most unquestionable authorities, against the petitions of the commons, the
acts of the legislature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the testimony of historians and lawyers, before
we could assert that England acquiesced in those abuses and oppressions
which it must be confessed she was unable fully to prevent.</p>

<p>The word prerogative is of a peculiar import, and scarcely understood by
those who come from the studies of political philosophy. We cannot define
it by any theory of executive functions. All these may be comprehended in
it; but also a great deal more. It is best, perhaps, to be understood by
its derivation, and has been said to be that law in case of the king which
is law in no case of the
subject.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Of the higher and more sovereign
prerogatives I shall here say nothing; they result from the nature of a
monarchy, and have nothing very peculiar in their character. But the
smaller rights of the crown show better the original lineaments of our
constitution. It is said commonly enough that all prerogatives are given
for the subject's good. I must confess that no part of this assertion
corresponds with my view of the subject. It neither appears to me that
these prerogatives were ever given nor that they necessarily redound to
the subject's good. Prerogative, in its old sense, might be defined an
advantage obtained by the crown over the subject, in cases where their
interests came into competition, by reason of its greater strength. This
sprang from the nature of the Norman government, which rather resembled a
scramble of wild beasts, where the strongest takes the best share, than a
system founded upon principles of common utility. And, modified as the
exercise of most prerogatives has been by the more liberal tone which now
pervades our course of government, whoever attends to the common practice
of courts of justice, and, still more, whoever consults the law-books,
will not only be astonished at their extent and multiplicity, but very
frequently at their injustice and severity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purveyance.</div>

<p>The real prerogatives that might formerly be exerted were sometimes of so
injurious a nature, that we can hardly separate them from their abuse: a
striking instance is that of purveyance, which will at once illustrate the
definition above given of a prerogative, the limits within which it was to
be exercised, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
tendency to transgress them. This was a right of
purchasing whatever was necessary for the king's household, at a fair
price, in preference to every competitor, and without the consent of the
owner. By the same prerogative, carriages and horses were impressed for
the king's journeys, and lodgings provided for his attendants. This was
defended on a pretext of necessity, or at least of great convenience to
the sovereign, and was both of high antiquity and universal practice
throughout Europe. But the royal purveyors had the utmost temptation, and
doubtless no small store of precedents, to stretch this power beyond its
legal boundary; and not only to fix their own price too low, but to seize
what they wanted without any payment at all, or with tallies which were
carried in vain to an empty
exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
This gave rise to a number of
petitions from the commons, upon which statutes were often framed; but the
evil was almost incurable in its nature, and never ceased till that
prerogative was itself abolished. Purveyance, as I have already said, may
serve to distinguish the defects from the abuses of our constitution. It
was a reproach to the law that men should be compelled to send their goods
without their consent; it was a reproach to the administration that they
were deprived of them without payment.</p>

<p>The right of purchasing men's goods for the use of the king was extended
by a sort of analogy to their labour. Thus Edward III. announces to all
sheriffs that William of Walsingham had a commission to collect as many
painters as might suffice for "our works in St. Stephen's chapel,
Westminster, to be at our wages as long as shall be necessary," and to
arrest and keep in prison all who should refuse or be refractory; and
enjoins them to lend their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
assistance.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> Windsor Castle owes its
massive magnificence to labourers impressed from every part of the
kingdom. There is even a commission from Edward IV. to take as many
workmen in gold as were wanting, and employ them at the king's cost upon
the trappings of himself and his household.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[o]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Abuses of feudal rights.</div>

<p>Another class of abuses intimately connected with unquestionable though
oppressive rights of the crown originated in the feudal tenure which bound
all the lands of the kingdom. The king had indisputably a right to the
wardship of his tenants in chivalry, and to the escheats or forfeitures of
persons dying without heirs or attainted for treason. But his officers,
under pretence of wardship, took possession of lands not held immediately
of the crown, claimed escheats where a right heir existed, and seized
estates as forfeited which were protected by the statute of entails. The
real owner had no remedy against this disposition but to prefer his
petition of right in chancery, or, which was probably more effectual, to
procure a remonstrance of the house of commons in his favour. Even where
justice was finally rendered to him he had no recompense for his damages;
and the escheators were not less likely to repeat an iniquity by which
they could not personally suffer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forest laws.</div>

<p>The charter of the forests, granted by Henry III. along with Magna
Charta,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
had been designed to crush the flagitious system of
oppression which prevailed in those favourite haunts of the Norman kings.
They had still, however, their peculiar jurisdiction, though, from the
time at least of Edward III., subject in some measure to the control of
the King's Bench.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
The foresters, I suppose, might find a compensation for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
their want of the common law in that easy and licentious way of life
which they affected; but the neighbouring cultivators frequently suffered
from the king's officers who attempted to recover those adjacent lands,
or, as they were called, purlieus, which had been disafforested by the
charter and protected by frequent perambulations. Many petitions of the
commons relate to this grievance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jurisdiction of constable and marshal.</div>

<p>The constable and marshal of England possessed a jurisdiction, the proper
limits whereof were sufficiently narrow, as it seems, to have extended
only to appeals of treason committed beyond sea, which were determined by
combat, and to military offences within the realm. But these high officers
frequently took upon them to inquire of treasons and felonies cognizable
at common law, and even of civil contracts and trespasses. This is no bad
illustration of the state in which our constitution stood under the
Plantagenets. No colour of right or of supreme prerogative was set up to
justify a procedure so manifestly repugnant to the great charter. For all
remonstrances against these encroachments the king gave promises in
return; and a statute was enacted, in the thirteenth of Richard II.,
declaring the bounds of the constable and marshal's
jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> It
could not be denied, therefore, that all infringements of these
acknowledged limits were illegal, even if they had a hundred fold more
actual precedents in their favour than can be supposed. But the abuse by
no means ceased after the passing of this statute, as several subsequent
petitions that it might be better regarded will evince. One, as it
contains a special instance, I shall insert. It is of the fifth year of
Henry IV.: "On several supplications and petitions made by the commons in
parliament to our lord the king for Bennet Wilman, who is accused by
certain of his ill-wishers and detained in prison, and put to answer
before the constable and marshal, against the statutes and the common law
of England, our said lord the king, by the advice and assent of the lords
in parliament, granted that the said Bennet should be treated according to
the statutes and common law of England, notwithstanding any commission to
the contrary, or accusation against him made before the constable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and marshal." And a writ was sent to the justices of the King's Bench with a
copy of this article from the roll of parliament, directing them to
proceed as they shall see fit according to the laws and customs of
England.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[s]</a></p>

<p>It must appear remarkable that, in a case so manifestly within their
competence, the court of King's Bench should not have issued a writ of
habeas corpus, without waiting for what may be considered as a particular
act of parliament. But it is a natural effect of an arbitrary
administration of government to intimidate courts of
justice.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> A
negative argument, founded upon the want of legal precedent, is certainly
not conclusive when it relates to a distant period, of which all the
precedents have not been noted; yet it must strike us that in the learned
and zealous arguments of Sir Robert Cotton, Mr. Selden, and others,
against arbitrary imprisonment, in the great case of the habeas corpus,
though the statute law is full of authorities in their favour, we find no
instance adduced earlier than the reign of Henry VII., where the King's
Bench has released, or even bailed, persons committed by the council or
the constable, though it is unquestionable that such committals were both
frequent and illegal.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
If I have faithfully represented thus far the history of our
constitution, its essential character will appear to be a monarchy greatly
limited by law, though retaining much power that was ill calculated to
promote the public good, and swerving continually into an irregular
course, which there was no restraint adequate to correct. But of all the
notions that have been advanced as to the theory of this constitution, the
least consonant to law and history is that which represents the king as
merely an hereditary executive magistrate, the first officer of the state.
What advantages might result from such a form of government this is not
the place to discuss. But it certainly was not the ancient constitution of
England. There was nothing in this, absolutely nothing, of a republican
appearance. All seemed to grow out of the monarchy, and was referred to
its advantage and honour. The voice of supplication, even in the stoutest
disposition of the commons, was always humble; the prerogative was always
named in large and pompous expressions. Still more naturally may we expect
to find in the law-books even an obsequious deference to power, from
judges who scarcely ventured to consider it as their duty to defend the
subject's freedom, and who beheld the gigantic image of prerogative, in
the full play of its hundred arms, constantly before their eyes. Through
this monarchical tone, which certainly pervades all our legal authorities,
a writer like Hume, accustomed to philosophical liberality as to the
principles of government, and to the democratical language which the
modern aspect of the constitution and the liberty of printing have
produced, fell hastily into the error of believing that all limitations of
royal power during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were as much
unsettled in law and in public opinion as they were liable to be violated
by force. Though a contrary position has been sufficiently demonstrated, I
conceive, by the series of parliamentary proceedings which I have already
produced, yet there is a passage in Sir John Fortescue's treatise De
Laudibus Legum Angli√¶, so explicit and weighty, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> no writer on the
English constitution can be excused from inserting it. This eminent
person, having been chief justice of the King's Bench under Henry VI., was
governor to the young prince of Wales during his retreat in France, and
received at his hands the office of chancellor. It must never be forgotten
that, in a treatise purposely composed for the instruction of one who
hoped to reign over England, the limitations of government are enforced as
strenuously by Fortescue, as some succeeding lawyers have inculcated the
doctrines of arbitrary prerogative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir John Fortescue's doctrine as to the English constitution.</div>

<p>"A king of England cannot at his pleasure make any alterations in the laws
of the land, for the nature of his government is not only regal, but
political. Had it been merely regal, he would have a power to make what
innovations and alterations he pleased in the laws of the kingdom, impose
tallages and other hardships upon the people whether they would or no,
without their consent, which sort of government the civil laws point out
when they declare Quod principi placuit, legis habet vigorem. But it is
much otherwise with a king whose government is political, because he can
neither make any alteration or change in the laws of the realm without the
consent of the subjects, nor burthen them against their wills with strange
impositions, so that a people governed by such laws as are made by their
own consent and approbation enjoy their properties securely, and without
the hazard of being deprived of them, either by the king or any other. The
same things may be effected under an absolute prince, provided he do not
degenerate into the tyrant. Of such a prince, Aristotle, in the third of
his Politics, says, 'It is better for a city to be governed by a good man
than by good laws.' But because it does not always happen that the person
presiding over a people is so qualified, St. Thomas, in the book which he
writ to the king of Cyprus, De Regimine Principum, wishes that a kingdom
could be so instituted as that the king might not be at liberty to
tyrannize over his people; which only comes to pass in the present case;
that is, when the sovereign power is restrained by political laws.
Rejoice, therefore, my good prince, that such is the law of the kingdom
which you are to inherit, because it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
afford, both to yourself and
subjects, the greatest security and
satisfaction."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<p>The two great divisions of civil rule, the absolute, or regal as he calls
it, and the political, Fortescue proceeds to deduce from the several
originals of conquest and compact. Concerning the latter he declares
emphatically a truth not always palatable to princes, that such
governments were instituted by the people, and for the people's good;
quoting St. Augustin for a similar definition of a political society. "As
the head of a body natural cannot change its nerves and sinews, cannot
deny to the several parts their proper energy, their due proportion and
aliment of blood; neither can a king, who is the head of a body politic,
change the laws thereof, nor take from the people what is theirs by right
against their consent. Thus you have, sir, the formal institution of every
political kingdom, from whence you may guess at the power which a king may
exercise with respect to the laws and the subject. For he is appointed to
protect his subjects in their lives, properties, and laws; for this very
end and purpose he has the delegation of power from the people, and he has
no just claim to any other power but this. Wherefore, to give a brief
answer to that question of yours, concerning the different powers which
kings claim over their subjects, I am firmly of opinion that it arises
solely from the different natures of their original institution, as you
may easily collect from what has been said. So the kingdom of England had
its original from Brute, and the Trojans, who attended him from Italy and
Greece, and became a mixed kind of government, compounded of the regal and
political."<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Erroneous views taken by Hume.</div>

<p>It would occupy too much space to quote every other passage of the same
nature in this treatise of Fortescue, and in that entitled, Of the
Difference between an Absolute and Limited Monarchy, which, so far as
these points are concerned, is nearly a translation from the
former.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
But these, corroborated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
as they are by the statute-book and by the rolls
of parliament, are surely conclusive against the notions which pervade Mr.
Hume's History. I have already remarked that a sense of the glaring
prejudice by which some Whig writers had been actuated, in representing
the English constitution from the earliest times as nearly arrived at its
present perfection, conspired with certain prepossessions of his own to
lead this eminent historian into an equally erroneous system on the
opposite side. And as he traced the stream backwards, and came last to the
times of the Plantagenet dynasty, with opinions already biassed and even
pledged to the world in his volumes of earlier publication, he was prone
to seize hold of, and even exaggerate, every circumstance that indicated
immature civilization, and law perverted or
infringed.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> To this his
ignorance of English jurisprudence which certainly in some measure
disqualified him from writing our history, did not a little contribute;
misrepresentations frequently occurring in his work, which a moderate
acquaintance with the law of the land would have
prevented.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Instances of illegal condemnation rare.</div>

<p>It is an honourable circumstance to England that the history of no other
country presents so few instances of illegal condemnations upon political
charges. The judicial torture was hardly known and never recognised by
law.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
sentence in capital crimes, fixed unalterably by custom,
allowed nothing to vindictiveness and indignation. There hardly occurs an
example of any one being notoriously put to death without form of trial,
except in moments of flagrant civil war. If the rights of juries were
sometimes evaded by irregular jurisdictions, they were at least held
sacred by the courts of law: and through all the vicissitudes of civil
liberty, no one ever questioned the primary right of every freeman, handed
down from his Saxon forefathers, to the trial by his peers. A just regard
for public safety prescribes the necessity of severe penalties against
rebellion and conspiracy; but the interpretation of these offences, when
intrusted to sovereigns and their counsellors, has been the most
tremendous instrument of despotic power. In rude ages, even though a
general spirit of political liberty may prevail, the legal character of
treason will commonly be undefined; nor is it the disposition of lawyers
to give greater accuracy to this part of criminal jurisprudence. The
nature of treason appears to have been subject to much uncertainty in
England before the statute of Edward III. If that memorable law did not
give all possible precision to the offence, which we must certainly allow,
it prevented at least those stretches of vindictive tyranny which disgrace
the annals of other countries. The praise, however, must be understood as
comparative. Some cases of harsh if not illegal convictions could hardly
fail to occur in times of violence and during changes of the reigning
family. Perhaps the circumstances have now and then been aggravated by
historians. Nothing could be more illegal than the conviction of the earl
of Cambridge and lord Scrope in 1415, if it be true, according to Carte
and Hume, that they were not heard in their defence. But whether this is
to be absolutely inferred from the
record<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
is perhaps open to question. There seems at least to have been no sufficient motive for such
an irregularity; their participation in a treasonable conspiracy being manifest from their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
confession. The proceedings against Sir John
Mortimer in the 2nd of Henry
VI.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
are called by Hume highly irregular
and illegal. They were, however, by act of attainder, which cannot well be
styled illegal. Nor are they to be considered as severe. Mortimer had
broken out of the Tower, where he was confined on a charge of treason.
This was a capital felony at common law; and the chief irregularity seems
to have consisted in having recourse to parliament in order to attaint him
of treason, when he had already forfeited his life by another crime.</p>

<p>I would not willingly attribute to the prevalence of Tory dispositions
what may be explained otherwise, the progress which Mr. Hume's historical
theory as to our constitution has been gradually making since its
publication. The tide of opinion, which since the Revolution, and indeed
since the reign of James I., had been flowing so strongly in favour of the
antiquity of our liberties, now seems, among the higher and more literary
classes, to set pretty decidedly the other way. Though we may still
sometimes hear a demagogue chattering about the witenagemot, it is far
more usual to find sensible and liberal men who look on Magna Charta
itself as the result of an uninteresting squabble between the king and his
barons. Acts of force and injustice, which strike the cursory inquirer,
especially if he derives his knowledge from modern compilations, more than
the average tenor of events, are selected and displayed as fair samples of
the law and of its administration. We are deceived by the comparatively
perfect state of our present liberties, and forget that our superior
security is far less owing to positive law than to the control which is
exercised over government by public opinion through the general use of
printing, and to the diffusion of liberal principles in policy through the
same means. Thus disgusted at a contrast which it was hardly candid to
institute, we turn away from the records that attest the real, though
imperfect, freedom of our ancestors; and are willing to be persuaded that
the whole scheme of English polity, till the commons took on themselves to
assert their natural rights against James I., was at best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> but a mockery
of popular privileges, hardly recognised in theory, and never regarded in
effect.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

<p>This system, when stripped of those slavish inferences that Brady and
Carte attempted to build upon it, admits perhaps of no essential objection
but its want of historical truth. God forbid that our rights to just and
free government should be tried by a jury of antiquaries! Yet it is a
generous pride that intertwines the consciousness of hereditary freedom
with the memory of our ancestors; and no trifling argument against those
who seem indifferent in its cause, that the character of the bravest and
most virtuous among nations has not depended upon the accidents of race or
climate, but been gradually wrought by the plastic influence of civil
rights, transmitted as a prescriptive inheritance through a long course of
generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes tending to form the constitution.</div>

<p>By what means the English acquired and preserved this political liberty,
which, even in the fifteenth century, was the admiration of judicious
foreigners,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
is a very rational and interesting inquiry. Their own
serious and steady attachment to the laws must always be reckoned among
the principal causes of this blessing. The civil equality of all freemen
below the rank of peerage, and the subjection of peers themselves to the
impartial arm of justice, and to a due share in contribution to public
burthens, advantages unknown to other countries, tended to identify the
interests and to assimilate the feelings of the aristocracy with those of
the people; classes whose dissension and jealousy has been in many
instances the surest hope of sovereigns aiming at arbitrary power. This
freedom from the oppressive superiority of a privileged order was peculiar
to England. In many kingdoms the royal prerogative was at least equally
limited. The statutes of Aragon are more full of remedial provisions. The
right of opposing a tyrannical government by arms was more frequently
asserted in Castile. But nowhere else did the people possess by law, and I
think, upon the whole, in effect, so much security for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> their personal
freedom and property. Accordingly, the middling ranks flourished
remarkably, not only in commercial towns, but among the cultivators of the
soil. "There is scarce a small village," says Sir J. Fortescue, "in which
you may not find a knight, an esquire, or some substantial householder
(paterfamilias), commonly called a
frankleyn,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> possessed of
considerable estate; besides others who are called freeholders, and many
yeomen of estates sufficient to make a substantial jury." I would,
however, point out more particularly two causes which had a very leading
efficacy in the gradual development of our constitution; first, the
schemes of continental ambition in which our government was long engaged;
secondly, the manner in which feudal principles of insubordination and
resistance were modified by the prerogatives of the early Norman kings.</p>

<p>1. At the epoch when William the Conqueror ascended the throne, hardly any
other power was possessed by the king of France than what he inherited
from the great fiefs of the Capetian family. War with such a potentate was
not exceedingly to be dreaded, and William, besides his immense revenue,
could employ the feudal services of his vassals, which were extended by
him to continental expeditions. These circumstances were not essentially
changed till after the loss of Normandy; for the acquisitions of Henry II.
kept him fully on an equality with the French crown, and the dilapidation
which had taken place in the royal demesnes was compensated by several
arbitrary resources that filled the exchequer of these monarchs. But in
the reigns of John and Henry III., the position of England, or rather of
its sovereign, with respect to France, underwent a very disadvantageous
change. The loss of Normandy severed the connexion between the English
nobility and the continent; they had no longer estates to defend, and took not sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
interest in the concerns of Guienne to fight for that
province at their own cost. Their feudal service was now commuted for an
escuage, which fell very short of the expenses incurred in a protracted
campaign. Tallages of royal towns and demesne lands, extortion of money
from the Jews, every feudal abuse and oppression, were tried in vain to
replenish the treasury, which the defence of Eleanor's inheritance against
the increased energy of France was constantly exhausting. Even in the most
arbitrary reigns, a general tax upon landholders, in any cases but those
prescribed by the feudal law, had not been ventured; and the standing
bulwark of Magna Charta, as well as the feebleness and unpopularity of
Henry III., made it more dangerous to violate an established principle.
Subsidies were therefore constantly required; but for these it was
necessary for the king to meet parliament, to hear their complaints, and,
if he could not elude, to acquiesce in their petitions. These necessities
came still more urgently upon Edward I., whose ambitious spirit could not
patiently endure the encroachments of Philip the Fair, a rival not less
ambitious, but certainly less distinguished by personal prowess, than
himself. What advantage the friends of liberty reaped from this ardour for
continental warfare is strongly seen in the circumstances attending the
Confirmation of the Charters.</p>

<p>But after this statute had rendered all tallages without consent of
parliament illegal, though it did not for some time prevent their being
occasionally imposed, it was still more difficult to carry on a war with
France or Scotland, to keep on foot naval armaments, or even to preserve
the courtly magnificence which that age of chivalry affected, without
perpetual recurrence to the house of commons. Edward III. very little
consulted the interests of his prerogative when he stretched forth his
hand to seize the phantom of a crown in France. It compelled him to
assemble parliament almost annually, and often to hold more than one
session within the year. Here the representatives of England learned the
habit of remonstrance and conditional supply; and though, in the meridian
of Edward's age and vigour, they often failed of immediate redress, yet
they gradually swelled the statute-roll with provisions to secure their country's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
freedom; and acquiring self-confidence by mutual intercourse,
and sense of the public opinion, they became able, before the end of
Edward's reign, and still more in that of his grandson, to control,
prevent, and punish the abuses of administration. Of all these proud and
sovereign privileges, the right of refusing supply was the keystone. But
for the long wars in which our kings were involved, at first by their
possession of Guienne, and afterwards by their pretensions upon the crown
of France, it would have been easy to suppress remonstrances by avoiding
to assemble parliament. For it must be confessed that an authority was
given to the king's proclamations, and to ordinances of the council, which
differed but little from legislative power, and would very soon have been
interpreted by complaisant courts of justice to give them the full extent
of statutes.</p>

<p>It is common indeed to assert that the liberties of England were bought
with the blood of our forefathers. This is a very magnanimous boast, and
in some degree is consonant enough to the truth. But it is far more
generally accurate to say that they were purchased by money. A great
proportion of our best laws, including Magna Charta itself, as it now
stands confirmed by Henry III., were, in the most literal sense, obtained
by a pecuniary bargain with the crown. In many parliaments of Edward III.
and Richard II. this sale of redress is chaffered for as distinctly, and
with as little apparent sense of disgrace, as the most legitimate business
between two merchants would be transacted. So little was there of
voluntary benevolence in what the loyal courtesy of our constitution
styles concessions from the throne; and so little title have these
sovereigns, though we cannot refuse our admiration to the generous virtues
of Edward III. and Henry V., to claim the gratitude of posterity as the
benefactors of their people!</p>

<p>2. The relation established between a lord and his vassal by the feudal
tenure, far from containing principles of any servile and implicit
obedience, permitted the compact to be dissolved in case of its violation
by either party. This extended as much to the sovereign as to inferior
lords; the authority of the former in France, where the system most
flourished, being for several ages rather feudal than political. If a vassal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
was aggrieved, and if justice was denied him, he sent a defiance,
that is, a renunciation of fealty to the king, and was entitled to enforce
redress at the point of his sword. It then became a contest of strength as
between two independent potentates, and was terminated by treaty,
advantageous or otherwise, according to the fortune of war. This
privilege, suited enough to the situation of France, the great peers of
which did not originally intend to admit more than a nominal supremacy in
the house of Capet, was evidently less compatible with the regular
monarchy of England. The stern natures of William the Conqueror and his
successors kept in control the mutinous spirit of their nobles, and reaped
the profit of feudal tenures without submitting to their reciprocal
obligations. They counteracted, if I may so say, the centrifugal force of
that system by the application of a stronger power; by preserving order,
administering justice, checking the growth of baronial influence and
riches, with habitual activity, vigilance, and severity. Still, however,
there remained the original principle, that allegiance depended
conditionally upon good treatment, and that an appeal might be lawfully
made to arms against an oppressive government. Nor was this, we may be
sure, left for extreme necessity, or thought to require a long enduring
forbearance. In modern times a king compelled by his subjects' swords to
abandon any pretension would be supposed to have ceased to reign; and the
express recognition of such a right as that of insurrection has been
justly deemed inconsistent with the majesty of law. But ruder ages had
ruder sentiments. Force was necessary to repel force; and men accustomed
to see the king's authority defied by private riot were not much shocked
when it was resisted in defence of public freedom.</p>

<p>The Great Charter of John was secured by the election of twenty-five
barons as conservators of the compact. If the king, of the justiciary in
his absence, should transgress any article, any four might demand
reparation, and on denial carry their complaint to the rest of their body.
"And those barons, with all the commons of the land, shall distrain and
annoy us by every means in their power; that is, by seizing our castles,
lands, and possessions, and every other mode, till the wrong shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
repaired to their satisfaction; saving our person, and our queen and
children. And when it shall be repaired they shall obey us as
before."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
It is amusing to see the common law of distress introduced
upon this gigantic scale; and the capture of the king's castles treated as
analogous to impounding a neighbour's horse for breaking fences.</p>

<p>A very curious illustration of this feudal principle is found in the
conduct of William earl of Pembroke, one of the greatest names in our
ancient history, towards Henry III. The king had defied him, which was
tantamount to a declaration of war; alleging that he had made an inroad
upon the royal domains. Pembroke maintained that he was not the aggressor,
that the king had denied him justice, and been the first to invade his
territory; on which account he had thought himself absolved from his
homage, and at liberty to use force against the malignity of the royal
advisers. "Nor would it be for the king's honour," the earl adds, "that I
should submit to his will against reason, whereby I should rather do wrong
to him and to that justice which he is bound to administer towards his
people; and I should give an ill example to all men in deserting justice
and right in compliance with his mistaken will. For this would show that I
loved my worldly wealth better than justice." These words, with whatever
dignity expressed, it may be objected, prove only the disposition of an
angry and revolted earl. But even Henry fully admitted the right of taking
arms against himself if he had meditated his vassal's destruction, and
disputed only the application of this maxim to the earl of
Pembroke.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<p>These feudal notions, which placed the moral obligation of allegiance very
low, acting under a weighty pressure from the real strength of the crown,
were favourable to constitutional liberty. The great vassals of France and
Germany aimed at living independently on their fiefs, with no further
concern for the rest than as useful allies having a common interest
against the crown. But in England, as there was no prospect of throwing
off subjection, the barons endeavoured only to lighten its burthen, fixing
limits to prerogative by law, and securing their observation by
parliamentary remonstrances or by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
dint of arms. Hence, as all rebellions
in England were directed only to coerce the government, or at the utmost
to change the succession of the crown, without the smallest tendency to
separation, they did not impair the national strength nor destroy the
character of the constitution. In all these contentions it is remarkable
that the people and clergy sided with the nobles against the throne. No
individuals are so popular with the monkish annalists, who speak the
language of the populace, as Simon earl of Leicester, Thomas earl of
Lancaster, and Thomas duke of Gloucester, all turbulent opposers of the
royal authority, and probably little deserving of their panegyrics. Very
few English historians of the middle ages are advocates of prerogative.
This may be ascribed both to the equality of our laws and to the interest
which the aristocracy found in courting popular favour, when committed
against so formidable an adversary as the king. And even now, when the
stream that once was hurried along gullies and dashed down precipices
hardly betrays upon its broad and tranquil bosom the motion that actuates
it, it must still be accounted a singular happiness of our constitution
that, all ranks graduating harmoniously into one another, the interests of
peers and commoners are radically interwoven; each in a certain sense
distinguishable, but not balanced like opposite weights, not separated
like discordant fluids, not to be secured by insolence or jealousy, but by
mutual adherence and reciprocal influences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence which the state of manners gave the nobility.</div>

<p>From the time of Edward I. the feudal system and all the feelings
connected with it declined very rapidly. But what the nobility lost in the
number of their military tenants was in some degree compensated by the
state of manners. The higher class of them, who took the chief share in
public affairs, were exceedingly opulent; and their mode of life gave
wealth an incredibly greater efficacy than it possesses at present.
Gentlemen of large estates and good families who had attached themselves
to these great peers, who bore offices which we should call menial in
their households, and sent their children thither for education, were of
course ready to follow their banner in rising, without much inquiry into
the cause. Still less would the vast body of tenants and their retainers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
who were fed at the castle in time of peace, refuse to carry their pikes
and staves into the field of battle. Many devices were used to preserve
this aristocratic influence, which riches and ancestry of themselves
rendered so formidable. Such was the maintenance of suits, or
confederacies for the purpose of supporting each other's claims in
litigation, which was the subject of frequent complaints in parliament,
and gave rise to several prohibitory statutes. By help of such
confederacies parties were enabled to make violent entries upon the lands
they claimed, which the law itself could hardly be said to
discourage.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Even proceedings in courts of justice were often liable
to intimidation and
influence.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
A practice much allied to
confederacies of maintenance, though ostensibly more harmless, was that of
giving liveries to all retainers of a noble family; but it had an obvious
tendency to preserve that spirit of factious attachments and animosities
which it is the general policy of a wise government to dissipate. From the
first year of Richard II. we find continual mention of this custom, with
many legal provisions against it, but it was never abolished till the
reign of Henry VII.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[o]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Prevalent habits of rapine.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
These associations under powerful chiefs were only incidentally beneficial
as they tended to withstand the abuses of prerogative. In their more usual
course they were designed to thwart the legitimate exercise of the king's
government in the administration of the laws. All Europe was a scene of
intestine anarchy during the middle ages; and though England was far less
exposed to the scourge of private war than most nations on the continent,
we should find, could we recover the local annals of every country, such
an accumulation of petty rapine and tumult as would almost alienate us
from the liberty which served to engender it. This was the common tenor of
manners, sometimes so much aggravated as to find a place in general
history,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
more often attested by records during the three centuries
that the house of Plantagenet sat on the throne. Disseisin, or forcible
dispossession of freeholds, makes one of the most considerable articles in
our law-books.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
Highway robbery was from the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> times a sort of
national crime. Capital punishments, though very frequent, made little
impression on a bold and a licentious crew, who had at least the sympathy
of those who had nothing to lose on their side, and flattering prospects
of impunity. We know how long the outlaws of Sherwood lived in
tradition&mdash;men who, like some of their betters, have been permitted to
redeem by a few acts of generosity the just ignominy of extensive crimes.
These, indeed, were the heroes of vulgar applause; but when such a judge
as Sir John Fortescue could exult that more Englishmen were hanged for
robbery in one year than French in seven, and that, "if an Englishman be
poor, and see another having riches which may be taken from him by might,
he will not spare to do
so,"<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
it may be perceived how thoroughly these sentiments had pervaded the public mind.</p>

<p>Such robbers, I have said, had flattering prospects of impunity. Besides
the general want of communication, which made one who had fled from his
own neighbourhood tolerably secure, they had the advantage of extensive
forests to facilitate their depredations and prevent detection. When
outlawed or brought to trial, the worst offenders could frequently
purchase charters of pardon, which defeated justice in the moment of her
blow.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> Nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
were the nobility ashamed to patronise men guilty of every
crime. Several proofs of this occur in the rolls. Thus, for example, in
the 22nd of Edward III., the commons pray that, "whereas it is notorious
how robbers and malefactors infest the country, the king would charge the
great men of the land that none such be maintained by them, privily or
openly, but that they lend assistance to arrest and take such
ill-doers."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p>It is perhaps the most meritorious part of Edward I.'s government that he
bent all his power to restrain these breaches of tranquillity. One of his
salutary provisions is still in constant use, the statute of coroners.
Another, more extensive, and, though partly obsolete, the foundation of
modern laws, is the statute of Winton, which, reciting that "from day to
day robberies, murders, burnings, and theft be more often used than they
have been heretofore, and felons cannot be attainted by the oath of jurors
which had rather suffer robberies on strangers to pass without punishment
than indite the offenders, of whom great part be people of the same
country, or at least, if the offenders be of another country, the
receivers be of places near," enacts that hue and cry shall be made upon
the commission of a robbery, and that the hundred shall remain answerable
for the damage unless the felons be brought to justice. It may be inferred from this provision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
that the ancient law of frank-pledge, though retained
longer in form, had lost its efficiency. By the same act, no stranger or
suspicious person was to lodge even in the suburbs of towns; the gates
were to be kept locked from sunset to sunrising; every host to be
answerable for his guest; the highways to be cleared of trees and
underwood for two hundred feet on each side; and every man to keep arms
according to his substance in readiness to follow the sheriff on hue and
cry raised ofter felons.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
The last provision indicates that the
robbers plundered the country in formidable bands. One of these, in a
subsequent part of Edward's reign, burned the town of Boston during a
fair, and obtained a vast booty, though their leader had the ill fortune
not to escape the gallows.</p>

<p>The preservation of order throughout the country was originally intrusted
not only to the sheriff, coroner, and constables, but to certain
magistrates called conservators of the peace. These, in conformity to the
democratic character of our Saxon government, were elected by the
freeholders in their county
court.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
But Edward I. issued commissions
to carry into effect the statute of Winton; and from the beginning of
Edward III.'s reign the appointment of conservators was vested in the
crown, their authority gradually enlarged by a series of statutes, and
their titles changed to that of justices. They were empowered to imprison
and punish all rioters and other offenders, and such as they should find
by indictment or suspicion to be reputed thieves or vagabonds, and to take
sureties for good behaviour from persons of evil
fame.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> Such a
jurisdiction was hardly more arbitrary than, in a free and civilized age,
it has been thought fit to vest in magistrates; but it was ill endured by
a people who placed their notions of liberty in personal exemption from
restraint rather than any political theory. An act having been passed (2
R. II. stat. 2, c. 6), in consequence of unusual riots and outrages,
enabling magistrates to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
commit the ringleaders of tumultuary assemblies
without waiting for legal process till the next arrival of justices of
gaol delivery, the commons petitioned next year against this "horrible
grievous ordinance," by which "every freeman in the kingdom would be in
bondage to these justices," contrary to the great charter, and to many
statutes, which forbid any man to be taken without due course of
law.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
So sensitive was their jealousy of arbitrary imprisonment, that they
preferred enduring riot and robbery to chastising them by any means that
might afford a precedent to oppression, or weaken men's reverence for
Magna Charta.</p>

<p>There are two subjects remaining to which this retrospect of the state of
manners naturally leads us, and which I would not pass unnoticed, though
not perhaps absolutely essential to a constitutional history; because they
tend in a very material degree to illustrate the progress of society, with
which civil liberty and regular government are closely connected. These
are, first, the servitude or villenage of the peasantry, and their gradual
emancipation from that condition; and, secondly, the continual increase of
commercial intercourse with foreign countries. But as the latter topic
will fall more conveniently into the next part of this work, I shall
postpone its consideration for the present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Villenage of the peasantry. Its nature and gradual extinction.</div>

<p>In a former passage I have remarked of the Anglo-Saxon ceorls that neither
their situation nor that of their descendants for the earlier reigns after
the Conquest appears to have been mere servitude. But from the time of
Henry II., as we learn from Glanvil, the villein, so called, was
absolutely dependent upon his lord's will, compelled to unlimited
services, and destitute of property, not only in the land he held for his
maintenance, but in his own
acquisitions.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
If a villein purchased or
inherited land, the lord might seize it; if he accumulated stock, its
possession was equally precarious. Against his lord he had no right of
action; because his indemnity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in damages, if he could have recovered any,
might have been immediately taken away. If he fled from his lord's
service, or from the land which he held, a writ issued de nativitate
proband√¢, and the master recovered his fugitive by law. His children were
born to the same state of servitude; and, contrary to the rule of the
civil law, where one parent was free and the other in villenage, the
offspring followed their father's
condition.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>This was certainly a severe lot; yet there are circumstances which
materially distinguish it from slavery. The condition of villenage, at
least in later times, was perfectly relative; it formed no distinct order
in the political economy. No man was a villein in the eye of law, unless
his master claimed him: to all others he was a freeman, and might acquire,
dispose of, or sue for property without impediment. Hence Sir E. Coke
argues that villeins are included in the 29th article of Magna Charta: "No
freeman shall be disseised nor
imprisoned."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
For murder, rape, or mutilation of his villein, the lord was indictable at the king's suit;
though not for assault or imprisonment, which were within the sphere of his seignorial
authority.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
This class was distinguished into villeins regardant, who had been
attached from time immemorial to a certain manor, and villeins in gross,
where such territorial prescription had never existed, or had been broken.
In the condition of these, whatever has been said by some writers, I can
find no manner of difference; the distinction was merely technical, and
affected only the mode of
pleading.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
The term in gross is appropriated
in our legal language to property held absolutely and without reference to
any other. Thus it is applied to rights of advowson or of common, when
possessed simply and not as incident to any particular lands. And there
can be no doubt that it was used in the same sense for the possession of a
villein.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
But there was a class of persons, sometimes inaccurately
confounded with villeins, whom it is more important to separate. Villenage
had a double sense, as it related to persons or to lands. As all men were
free or villeins, so all lands were held by a free or villein tenure. As a
villein might be enfeoffed of freeholds, though they lay at the mercy of
his lord, so a freeman might hold tenements in villenage. In this case his
personal liberty subsisted along with the burthens of territorial
servitude. He was bound to arbitrary service at the will of the lord, and
he might by the same will be at any moment dispossessed; for such was the
condition of his tenure. But his chattels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
were secure from seizure, his
person from injury, and he might leave the land whenever he
pleased.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>From so disadvantageous a condition as this of villenage it may cause some
surprise that the peasantry of England should have ever emerged. The law
incapacitating a villein from acquiring property, placed, one would
imagine, an insurmountable barrier in the way of his enfranchisement. It
followed from thence, and is positively said by Glanvil, that a villein
could not buy his freedom, because the price he tendered would already belong to his
lord.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
And even in the case of free tenants in villenage
it is not easy to comprehend how their uncertain and unbounded services
could ever pass into slight pecuniary commutations; much less how they
could come to maintain themselves in their lands, and mock the lord with a
nominal tenure according to the custom of the manor.</p>

<p>This, like many others relating to the progress of society, is a very
obscure inquiry. We can trace the pedigree of princes, fill up the
catalogue of towns besieged and provinces desolated, describe even the
whole pageantry of coronations and festivals, but we cannot recover the
genuine history of mankind. It has passed away with slight and partial
notice by contemporary writers; and our most patient industry can hardly
at present put together enough of the fragments to suggest a tolerably
clear representation of ancient manners and social life. I cannot profess
to undertake what would require a command of books as well as leisure
beyond my reach; but the following observations may tend a little to
illustrate our immediate subject, the gradual extinction of villenage.</p>

<p>If we take what may be considered as the simplest case, that of a manor
divided into demesne lands of the lord's occupation and those in the
tenure of his villeins, performing all the services of agriculture for
him, it is obvious that his interest was to maintain just so many of these
as his estate required for its cultivation. Land, the cheapest of
articles, was the price of their labour; and though the law did not compel
him to pay this or any other price, yet necessity, repairing in some degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the law's injustice, made those pretty secure of food and
dwellings who were to give the strength of their arms for his advantage.
But in course of time, as alienations of small parcels of manors to free
tenants came to prevail, the proprietors of land were placed in a new
situation relatively to its cultivators. The tenements in villenage,
whether by law or usage, were never separated from the lordship, while its
domain was reduced to a smaller extent through subinfeudations, sales, or
demises for valuable rent. The purchasers under these alienations had
occasion for labourers; and these would be free servants in respect of
such employers, though in villenage to their original lord. As he demanded
less of their labour, through the diminution of his domain, they had more
to spare for other masters; and retaining the character of villeins and
the lands they held by that tenure, became hired labourers in husbandry
for the greater part of the year. It is true that all their earnings were
at the lord's disposal, and that he might have made a profit of their
labour when he ceased to require it for his own land. But this, which the
rapacity of more commercial times would have instantly suggested, might
escape a feudal superior, who, wealthy beyond his wants, and guarded by
the haughtiness of ancestry against the desire of such pitiful gains, was
better pleased to win the affection of his dependants than to improve his
fortune at their expense.</p>

<p>The services of villenage were gradually rendered less onerous and
uncertain. Those of husbandry, indeed, are naturally uniform, and might be
anticipated with no small exactness. Lords of generous tempers granted
indulgences which were either intended to be or readily became perpetual.
And thus, in the time of Edward I., we find the tenants in some manors
bound only to stated services, as recorded in the lord's
book.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> Some
of these, perhaps, might be villeins by blood; but free tenants in
villenage were still more likely to obtain this precision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> in their
services; and from claiming a customary right to be entered in the
court-roll upon the same terms as their predecessors, prevailed at length
to get copies of it for their
security.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Proofs of this remarkable
transformation from tenants in villenage to copyholders are found in the
reign of Henry III. I do not know, however, that they were protected, at
so early an epoch, in the possession of their estates. But it is said in
the Year-book of the 42nd of Edward III. to be "admitted for clear law,
that, if the customary tenant or copyholder does not perform his services,
the lord may seize his land as
forfeited."<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
It seems implied herein,
that, so long as the copyholder did continue to perform the regular
stipulations of his tenure, the lord was not at liberty to divest him of
his estate; and this is said to be confirmed by a passage in Britton,
which has escaped my search; though Littleton intimates that copyholders
could have no remedy against their
lord.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
However, in the reign of
Edward IV. this was put out of doubt by the judges, who permitted the
copyholder to bring his action of trespass against the lord for
dispossession.</p>

<p>While some of the more fortunate villeins crept up into property as well
as freedom under the name of copyholders, the greater part enfranchised
themselves in a different manner. The law, which treated them so harshly,
did not take away the means of escape; nor was this a matter of difficulty
in such a country as England. To this, indeed, the unequal progression of
agriculture and population in different counties would have naturally
contributed. Men emigrated, as they always must, in search of cheapness or employment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
according to the tide of human necessities. But the villein,
who had no additional motive to urge his steps away from his native place,
might well hope to be forgotten or undiscovered when he breathed a freer
air, and engaged his voluntary labour to a distant master. The lord had
indeed an action against him; but there was so little communication
between remote parts of the country, that it might be deemed his fault or
singular ill-fortune if he were compelled to defend himself. Even in that
case the law inclined to favour him; and so many obstacles were thrown in
the way of these suits to reclaim fugitive villeins, that they could not
have operated materially to retard their general
enfranchisement.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> In
one case, indeed, that of unmolested residence for a year and a day within
a walled city or borough, the villein became free, and the lord was
absolutely barred of his remedy. This provision is contained even in the
laws of William the Conqueror, as contained in Hoveden, and, if it be not
an interpolation, may be supposed to have had a view to strengthen the
population of those places which were designed for garrisons. This law,
whether of William or not, is unequivocally mentioned by
Glanvil.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> Nor
was it a mere letter. According to a record in the sixth of Edward II.,
Sir John Clavering sued eighteen villeins of his manor of Cossey, for
withdrawing themselves therefrom with their chattels; whereupon a writ was
directed to them; but six of the number claimed to be freemen, alleging
the Conqueror's charter, and offering to prove that they had lived in
Norwich, paying scot and lot, about thirty years; which claim was
admitted.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<p>By such means a large proportion of the peasantry before the middle of the
fourteenth century had become hired labourers instead of villeins. We
first hear of them on a grand scale in an ordinance made by Edward III. in
the twenty-third year of his reign. This was just after the dreadful
pestilence of 1348, and it recites that, the number of workmen and
servants having been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
greatly reduced by that calamity, the remainder
demanded excessive wages from their employers. Such an enhancement in the
price of labour, though founded exactly on the same principles as regulate
the value of any other commodity, is too frequently treated as a sort of
crime by lawgivers, who seem to grudge the poor that transient melioration
of their lot which the progress of population, or other analogous
circumstances, will, without any interference, very rapidly take away.
This ordinance therefore enacts that every man in England, of whatever
condition, bond or free, of able body, and within sixty years of age, not
living of his own, nor by any trade, shall be obliged, when required, to
serve any master who is willing to hire him at such wages as were usually
paid three years since, or for some time preceding; provided that the
lords of villeins or tenants in villenage shall have the preference of
their labour, so that they retain no more than shall be necessary for
them. More than these old wages is strictly forbidden to be offered, as
well as demanded. No one is permitted, under colour of charity, to give
alms to a beggar. And, to make some compensation to the inferior classes
for these severities, a clause is inserted, as wise, just, and practicable
as the rest, for the sale of provisions at reasonable
prices.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<p>This ordinance met with so little regard that a statute was made in
parliament two years after, fixing the wages of all artificers and
husbandmen, with regard to the nature and season of their labour. From
this time it became a frequent complaint of the commons that the statute
of labourers was not kept. The king had in this case, probably, no other
reason for leaving their grievance unredressed than his inability to
change the order of Providence. A silent alteration had been wrought in
the condition and character of the lower classes during the reign of
Edward III. This was the effect of increased knowledge and refinement,
which had been making a considerable progress for full half a century,
though they did not readily permeate the cold region of poverty and
ignorance. It was natural that the country people, or uplandish folk, as
they were called, should repine at the exclusion from that enjoyment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
competence, and security for the fruits of their labour, which the
inhabitants of towns so fully possessed. The fourteenth century was, in
many parts of Europe, the age when a sense of political servitude was most
keenly felt. Thus the insurrection of the Jacquerie in France about the
year 1358 had the same character, and resulted in a great measure from the
same causes, as that of the English peasants in 1382. And we may account
in a similar manner for the democratical tone of the French and Flemish
cities, and for the prevalence of a spirit of liberty in Germany and
Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[s]</a></p>

<p>I do not know whether we should attribute part of this revolutionary
concussion to the preaching of Wicliffe's disciples, or look upon both one
and the other as phenomena belonging to that particular epoch in the
progress of society. New principles, both as to civil rule and religion,
broke suddenly upon the uneducated mind, to render it bold, presumptuous,
and turbulent. But at least I make little doubt that the dislike of
ecclesiastical power, which spread so rapidly among the people at this
season, connected itself with a spirit of insubordination and an
intolerance of political subjection. Both were nourished by the same
teachers, the lower secular clergy; and however distinct we may think a
religious reformation from a civil anarchy, there was a good deal common
in the language by which the populace were inflamed to either one or the
other. Even the scriptural moralities which were then exhibited, and which
became the foundation of our theatre, afforded fuel to the spirit of
sedition. The common original and common destination of mankind, with
every other lesson of equality which religion supplies to humble or to
console, were displayed with coarse and glaring features in these
representations. The familiarity of such ideas has deadened their effects
upon our minds; but when a rude peasant, surprisingly destitute of
religious instruction during that corrupt age of the church, was led at
once to these impressive truths, we cannot be astonished at the
intoxication of mind they
produced.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Though I believe that, compared at least with the aristocracy of other
countries, the English lords were guilty of very little cruelty or
injustice, yet there were circumstances belonging to that period which
might tempt them to deal more hardly than before with their peasantry. The
fourteenth century was an age of greater magnificence than those which had
preceded, in dress, in ceremonies, in buildings; foreign luxuries were
known enough to excite an eager demand among the higher ranks, and yet so
scarce as to yield inordinate prices; while the landholders were, on the
other hand, impoverished by heavy and unceasing taxation. Hence it is
probable that avarice, as commonly happens, had given birth to oppression;
and if the gentry, as I am inclined to believe, had become more attentive
to agricultural improvements, it is reasonable to conjecture that those
whose tenure obliged them to unlimited services of husbandry were more
harassed than under their wealthy and indolent masters in preceding times.</p>

<p>The storm that almost swept away all bulwarks of civilized and regular
society seems to have been long in collecting itself. Perhaps a more
sagacious legislature might have contrived to disperse it: but the commons
only presented complaints of the refractoriness with which villeins and
tenants in villenage rendered their due
services;<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
and the exigencies
of government led to the fatal poll-tax of a groat, which was the
proximate cause of the insurrection. By the demands of these rioters we
perceive that territorial servitude was far from extinct; but it should
not be hastily concluded that they were all personal villeins, for a large
proportion were Kentish-men, to whom that condition could not have
applied; it being a good bar to a writ de nativitate proband√¢ that the
party's father was born in the county of
Kent.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
After this tremendous rebellion it might be expected that the legislature
would use little indulgence towards the lower commons. Such unhappy
tumults are doubly mischievous, not more from the immediate calamities
that attend them than from the fear and hatred of the people which they
generate in the elevated classes. The general charter of manumission
extorted from the king by the rioters of Blackheath was annulled by
proclamation to the
sheriffs,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
and this revocation approved by the
lords and commons in parliament; who added, as was very true, that such
enfranchisement could not be made without their consent; "which they would
never give to save themselves from perishing all together in one
day."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
Riots were turned into treason by a law of the same
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
By a very harsh statute in the 12th of Richard II. no
servant or labourer could depart, even at the expiration of his service,
from the hundred in which he lived without permission under the king's
seal; nor might any who had been bred to husbandry till twelve years old
exercise any other
calling.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
A few years afterwards the commons
petitioned that villeins might not put their children to school in order
to advance them by the church; "and this for the honour of all the freemen
of the kingdom." In the same parliament they complained that villeins fly
to cities and boroughs, whence their masters cannot recover them; and, if
they attempt it, are hindered by the people; and prayed that the lords
might seize their villeins in such places without regard to the franchises
thereof. But on both these petitions the king put in a
negative.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p>From henceforward we find little notice taken of villenage in
parliamentary records, and there seems to have been a rapid tendency to
its entire abolition. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
fifteenth century is barren of materials;
and we can only infer that, as the same causes which in Edward III.'s time
had converted a large portion of the peasantry into free labourers still
continued to operate, they must silently have extinguished the whole
system of personal and territorial servitude. The latter, indeed, was
essentially changed by the establishment of the law of copyhold.</p>

<p>I cannot presume to conjecture in what degree voluntary manumission is to
be reckoned among the means that contributed to the abolition of
villenage. Charters of enfranchisement were very common upon the
continent. They may perhaps have been less so in England. Indeed the
statute de donis must have operated very injuriously to prevent the
enfranchisement of villeins regardant, who were entailed along with the
land. Instances, however, occur from time to time, and we cannot expect to
discover many. One appears as early as the fifteenth year of Henry III.,
who grants to all persons born or to be born within his village of
Contishall, that they shall be free from all villenage in body and blood,
paying an aid of twenty shillings to knight the king's eldest son, and six
shillings a year as a
quit-rent.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
So in the twelfth of Edward III.
certain of the king's villeins are enfranchised on payment of a
fine.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
In strictness of law, a fine from the villein for the sake of
enfranchisement was nugatory, since all he could possess was already at
his lord's disposal. But custom and equity might easily introduce
different maxims; and it was plainly for the lord's interest to encourage
his tenants in the acquisition of money to redeem themselves, rather than
to quench the exertions of their industry by availing himself of an
extreme right. Deeds of enfranchisement occur in the reigns of Mary and
Elizabeth;<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
and perhaps a commission of the latter princess in 1574,
directing the enfranchisement of her bondmen and bondwomen on certain
manors upon payment of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
fine, is the last unequivocal testimony to the
existence of villenage;<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
though it is highly probable that it existed
in remote parts of the country some time
longer.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[h]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of Henry VI.</div>

<p>From this general view of the English constitution, as it stood about the
time of Henry VI., we must turn our eyes to the political revolutions
which clouded the latter years of his reign. The minority of this prince,
notwithstanding the vices and dissensions of his court and the inglorious
discomfiture of our arms in France, was not perhaps a calamitous period.
The country grew more wealthy; the law was, on the whole, better observed;
the power of parliament more complete and effectual than in preceding
times. But Henry's weakness of understanding, becoming evident as he
reached manhood, rendered his reign a perpetual minority. His marriage
with a princess of strong mind, but ambitious and vindictive, rather
tended to weaken the government and to accelerate his downfall; a certain
reverence that had been paid to the gentleness of the king's disposition
being overcome by her unpopularity. By degrees Henry's natural feebleness
degenerated almost into fatuity; and this unhappy condition seems to have
overtaken him nearly about the time when it became an arduous task to
withstand the assault in preparation against his government. This may
properly introduce a great constitutional subject, to which some peculiar
circumstances of our own age have imperiously directed the consideration
of parliament. Though the proceedings of 1788 and 1810 are undoubtedly
precedents of far more authority than any that can be derived from our
ancient history, yet, as the seal of the legislature has not yet been set
upon this controversy, it is not perhaps altogether beyond the possibility
of future discussion; and at least it cannot be uninteresting to look back
on those parallel or analogous cases by which the deliberations of
parliament upon the question of regency were guided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
While the kings of England retained their continental dominions, and were
engaged in the wars to which those gave birth, they were of course
frequently absent from this country. Upon such occasions the
administration seems at first to have devolved officially on the
justiciary, as chief servant of the crown. But Henry III. began the
practice of appointing lieutenants, or guardians of the realm (custodes
regni), as they were more usually termed, by way of temporary substitutes.
They were usually nominated by the king without consent of parliament; and
their office carried with it the right of exercising all the prerogatives
of the crown. It was of course determined by the king's return; and a
distinct statute was necessary in the reign of Henry V. to provide that a
parliament called by the guardian of the realm during the king's absence
should not be dissolved by that
event.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
The most remarkable
circumstance attending those lieutenancies was that they were sometimes
conferred on the heir apparent during his infancy. The Black Prince, then
duke of Cornwall, was left guardian of the realm in 1339, when he was but
ten years old;<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
and Richard his son, when still younger, in 1372,
during Edward III.'s last expedition into
France.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">at the accession of Henry III.;</div>

<div class="sidenote">of Edward I.;</div>

<div class="sidenote">of Edward III.;</div>

<div class="sidenote">of Richard II.;</div>

<p>These do not however bear a very close analogy to regencies in the
stricter sense, or substitutions during the natural incapacity of the
sovereign. Of such there had been several instances before it became
necessary to supply the deficiency arising from Henry's derangement. 1. At
the death of John, William earl of Pembroke assumed the title of rector
regis et regni, with the consent of the loyal barons who had just
proclaimed the young king, and probably conducted the government in a
great measure by their advice.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
But the circumstances were too
critical, and the time is too remote, to give this precedent any material
weight. 2. Edward I. being in Sicily at his father's death, the nobility
met at the Temple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
church, as we are informed by a contemporary writer,
and, after making a new great seal, appointed the archbishop of York,
Edward earl of Cornwall, and the earl of Gloucester, to be ministers and
guardians of the realm; who accordingly conducted the administration in
the king's name until his
return.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
It is here observable that the earl
of Cornwall, though nearest prince of the blood, was not supposed to enjoy
any superior title to the regency, wherein he was associated with two
other persons. But while the crown itself was hardly acknowledged to be
unquestionably hereditary, it would be strange if any notion of such a
right to the regency had been entertained. 3. At the accession of Edward
III., then fourteen years old, the parliament, which was immediately
summoned, nominated four bishops, four earls, and six barons as a standing
council, at the head of which the earl of Lancaster seems to have been
placed, to advise the king in all business of government. It was an
article in the charge of treason, or, as it was then styled, of
accroaching royal power, against Mortimer, that he intermeddled in the
king's household without the assent of this
council.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> They may be
deemed therefore a sort of parliamentary regency, though the duration of
their functions does not seem to be defined. 4. The proceedings at the
commencement of the next reign are more worthy of attention. Edward III.
dying June 21, 1377, the keepers of the great seal next day, in absence of
the chancellor beyond sea, gave it into the young king's hands before his
council. He immediately delivered it to the duke of Lancaster, and the
duke to Sir Nicholas Bode for safe custody. Four days afterwards the king
in council delivered the seal to the bishop of St. David's, who affixed it
the same day to divers letters
patent.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
Richard was at this time ten
years and six months old; an age certainly very unfit for the personal
execution of sovereign authority. Yet he was supposed capable of reigning
without the aid of a regency. This might be in virtue of a sort of magic
ascribed by lawyers to the great seal, the possession of which bars all
further inquiry, and renders any government legal. The practice of modern
times requiring the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
constant exercise of the sign manual has made a
public confession of incapacity necessary in many cases where it might
have been concealed or overlooked in earlier periods of the constitution.
But though no one was invested with the office of regent, a council of
twelve was named by the prelates and peers at the king's coronation, July
16, 1377, without whose concurrence no public measure was to be carried
into effect. I have mentioned in another place the modifications
introduced from time to time by parliament, which might itself be deemed a
great council of regency during the first years of Richard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">of Henry VI.</div>

<p>5. The next instance is at the accession of Henry VI. This prince was but
nine months old at his father's death; and whether from a more evident
incapacity for the conduct of government in his case than in that of
Richard II., or from the progress of constitutional principles in the
forty years elapsed since the latter's accession, far more regularity and
deliberation were shown in supplying the defect in the executive
authority. Upon the news arriving that Henry V. was dead, several lords
spiritual and temporal assembled, on account of the imminent necessity, in
order to preserve peace, and provide for the exercise of officers
appertaining to the king. These peers accordingly issued commissions to
judges, sheriffs, escheators, and others, for various purposes, and writs
for a new parliament. This was opened by commission under the great seal
directed to the duke of Gloucester, in the usual form, and with the king's
teste.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
Some ordinances were made in this parliament by the duke of
Gloucester as commissioner, and some in the king's name. The acts of the
peers who had taken on themselves the administration, and summoned
parliament, were confirmed. On the twenty-seventh day of its session, it
is entered upon the roll that the king, "considering his tender age, and
inability to direct in person the concerns of his realm, by assent of
lords and commons, appoints the duke of Bedford, or, in his absence beyond
sea, the duke of Gloucester, to be protector and defender of the kingdom
and English church, and the king's chief counsellor."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> Letters patent were
made out to this effect, the appointment being however expressly during
the king's pleasure. Sixteen councillors were named in parliament to
assist the protector in his administration; and their concurrence was made
necessary to the removal and appointment of officers, except some inferior
patronage specifically reserved to the protector. In all important
business that should pass by order of council, the whole, or major part,
were to be present; "but if it were such matter that the king hath been
accustomed to be counselled of, that then the said lords proceed not
therein without the advice of my lords of Bedford or
Gloucester."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> A
few more councillors were added by the next parliament, and divers
regulations established for their
observance.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p>This arrangement was in contravention of the late king's testament, which
had conferred the regency on the duke of Gloucester, in exclusion of his
elder brother. But the nature and spirit of these proceedings will be
better understood by a remarkable passage in a roll of a later parliament;
where the house of lords, in answer to a request of Gloucester that he
might know what authority he possessed as protector, remind him that in
the first parliament of the
king<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
"ye desired to have had ye

well by ye mene of your birth as by ye laste wylle of ye kyng yat was your

it was yought to your discretion made for your intent; whereupon, the
lords spiritual and temporal assembled there in parliament, among which
were there my lordes your uncles, the bishop of Winchester that now

gone to God, and of Warwick, and other in great number that now live, had
great and long deliberation and advice, searched precedents of the
governail of the land in time and case semblable, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> kings of this land

such persons as be notably learned therein, and finally found your said
desire not caused nor grounded in precedent, nor in the law of the land;
the which the king that dead is, in his life nor might by his last will
nor otherwise altre, change, nor abroge, without the assent of the three
estates, nor commit or grant to any person governance or rule of this land
longer than he lived; but on that other behalf, the said lords found your
said desire not according with the laws of this land, and against the
right and fredome of the estates of the same land. Howe were it that it be
not thought that any such thing wittingly proceeded of your intent; and
nevertheless to keep peace and tranquillity, and to the intent to ease and
appease you, it was advised and appointed by authority of the king,
assenting the three estates of this land, that ye, in absence of my lord
your brother of Bedford, should be chief of the king's council, and
devised unto you a name different from other counsellors, not the name of
tutor, lieutenant, governor, nor of regent, nor no name that should import
authority of governance of the land, but the name of protector and
defensor, which importeth a personal duty of attendance to the actual
defence of the land, as well against enemies outward, if case required, as
against rebels inward, if any were, that God forbid; granting you
therewith certain power, the which is specified and contained in an act of
the said parliament, to endure as long as it liked the king. In the which,
if the intent of the said estates had been that ye more power and
authority should have had, more should have been expressed therein; to the
which appointment, ordinance, and act, ye then agreed you as for your
person, making nevertheless protestation that it was not your intent in
any wise to deroge or do prejudice unto my lord your brother of Bedford by
your said agreement, as toward any right that he would pretend or claim in
the governance of this land; and as toward any pre-eminence that you might
have or belong unto you as chief of council, it is plainly declared in the
said act and articles, subscribed by my said lord of Bedford, by yourself,
and the other lords of the council. But as in parliament to which ye be
called upon your faith and ligeance as duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of Glocester, as other lords
be, and not otherwise, we know no power nor authority that ye have, other
than ye as duke of Glocester should have, the king being in parliament, at
years of mest discretion: We marvailing with all our hearts that,
considering the open declaration of the authority and power belonging to
my lord of Bedford and to you in his absence, and also to the king's
council subscribed purely and simply by my said lord of Bedford and by
you, that you should in any wise be stirred or moved not to content you
therewith or to pretend you any other: Namely, considering that the king,
blessed be our Lord, is, sith the time of the said power granted unto you,
far gone and grown in person, in wit, and understanding, and like with the
grace of God to occupy his own royal power within few years: and forasmuch
considering the things and causes abovesaid, and other many that long were
to write, We lords aforesaid pray, exhort, and require you to content you
with the power abovesaid and declared, of the which my lord your brother
of Bedford, the king's eldest uncle, contented him: and that ye none
larger power desire, will, nor use; giving you this that is aboven written
for our answer to your foresaid demand, the which we will dwell and abide
with, withouten variance or changing. Over this beseeching and praying you
in our most humble and lowly wise, and also requiring you in the king's
name, that ye, according to the king's commandment, contained in his writ
sent unto you in that behalf, come to this his present parliament, and
intend to the good effect and speed of matters to be demesned and treted
in the same, like as of right ye owe to
do."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that this plain, or rather rude address to the duke of
Gloucester, was dictated by the prevalence of cardinal Beaufort's party in
council and parliament. But the transactions in the former parliament are
not unfairly represented; and, comparing them with the passage extracted
above, we may perhaps be entitled to infer: 1. That the king does not
possess any constitutional prerogative of appointing a regent during the
minority of his successor; and 2. That neither the heir presumptive, nor
any other person, is entitled to exercise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the royal prerogative during
the king's infancy (or, by parity of reasoning, his infirmity), nor to any
title that conveys them; the sole right of determining the persons by
whom, and fixing the limitations under which, the executive government
shall be conducted in the king's name and behalf, devolving upon the great
council of parliament.</p>

<p>The expression used in the lords' address to the duke of Gloucester,
relative to the young king, that he was far gone and grown in person, wit,
and understanding, was not thrown out in mere flattery. In two years the
party hostile to Gloucester's influence had gained ground enough to
abrogate his office of protector, leaving only the honorary title of chief
counsellor.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
For this the king's coronation, at eight years of age,
was thought a fair pretence; and undoubtedly the loss of that exceedingly
limited authority which had been delegated to the protector could not have
impaired the strength of government. This was conducted as before by a
selfish and disunited council; but the king's name was sufficient to
legalize their measures, nor does any objection appear to have been made
in parliament to such a mockery of the name of monarchy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry's mental derangement.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Duke of York made protector.</div>

<p>In the year 1454, the thirty-second of Henry's reign, his unhappy malady,
transmitted perhaps from his maternal grandfather, assumed so decided a
character of derangement or imbecility, that parliament could no longer
conceal from itself the necessity of a more efficient ruler. This
assembly, which had been continued by successive prorogations for nearly a
year, met at Westminster on the 14th of February, when the session was
opened, by the duke of York, as king's commissioner. Kemp, archbishop of
Canterbury and chancellor of England, dying soon afterwards, it was judged
proper to acquaint the king at Windsor by a deputation of twelve lords
with this and other subjects concerning his government. In fact, perhaps,
this was a pretext chosen in order to ascertain his real condition. These
peers reported to the lords' house, two days afterwards, that they had
opened to his majesty the several articles of their message, but "could
get no answer ne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
sign for no prayer ne desire," though they repeated
their endeavours at three different interviews. This report, with the
instruction on which it was founded, was, at their prayer, entered of
record in parliament. Upon so authentic a testimony of their sovereign's
infirmity, the peers, adjourning two days for solemnity or deliberation,
"elected and nominated Richard duke of York to be protector and defender
of the realm of England during the king's pleasure." The duke, protesting
his insufficiency, requested "that in this present parliament, and by
authority thereof, it be enacted that, of yourself and of your ful and
mere disposition, ye desire, name, and call me to the said name and
charge, and that of any presumption of myself I take them not upon me, but
only of the due and humble obeisance that I owe to do unto the king our
most dread and sovereign lord, and to you the peerage of this land, in
whom by the occasion of the infirmity of our said sovereign lord resteth
the exercise of his authority, whose noble commandments I am as ready to
perform and obey as any of his liegemen alive, and that, at such time as
it shall please our blessed Creator to restore his most noble person to
healthful disposition, it shall like you so to declare and notify to his
good grace." To this protestation the lords answered that, for his and
their discharge, an act of parliament should be made conformably to that
enacted in the king's infancy, since they were compelled by an equal
necessity again to choose and name a protector and defender. And to the
duke of York's request to be informed how far the power and authority of
his charge should extend, they replied that he should be chief of the
king's council, and "devised therefore to the said duke a name different
from other counsellors, not the name of tutor, lieutenant, governor, nor
of regent, nor no name that shall import authority of governance of the
land; but the said name of protector and defensor;" and so forth,
according to the language of their former address to the duke of
Gloucester. An act was passed accordingly, constituting the duke of York
protector of the church and kingdom, and chief counsellor of the king,
during the latter's pleasure; or until the prince of Wales should attain
years of discretion on whom the said dignity was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> immediately to devolve.
The patronage of certain spiritual benefices was reserved to the protector
according to the precedent of the king's minority, which parliament was
resolved to follow in every
particular.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[z]</a></p>

<p>It may be conjectured, by the provision made in favour of the prince of
Wales, then only two years old, that the king's condition was supposed to
be beyond hope of restoration. But in about nine months he recovered
sufficient speech and recollection to supersede the duke of York's
protectorate.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
The succeeding transactions are matter of familiar,
though not, perhaps, very perspicuous history. The king was a prisoner in
his enemies' hands after the affair at St.
Albans,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
when parliament met in July, 1455. In this session little was done, except renewing the
strongest oaths of allegiance to Henry and his family. But the two houses
meeting again after a prorogation to November 12, during which time the
duke of York had strengthened his party, and was appointed by commission
the king's lieutenant to open the parliament, a proposition was made by
the commons that, "whereas the king had deputed the duke of York as his
commissioner to proceed in this parliament, it was thought by the commons
that, if the king hereafter could not attend to the protection of the
country, an able person should be appointed protector, to whom they might
have recourse for redress of injuries; especially as great disturbances
had lately arisen in the west through the feuds of the earl of Devonshire
and Lord Bonvile."<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
The archbishop of Canterbury answered for the
lords that they would take into consideration what the commons had
suggested. Two days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
afterwards the latter appeared again with a request
conveyed nearly in the same terms. Upon their leaving the chamber, the
archbishop, who was also chancellor, moved the peers to answer what should
be done in respect of the request of the commons; adding that "it is
understood that they will not further proceed in matters of parliament, to
the time that they have answer to their desire and request." This
naturally ended in the reappointment of the duke of York to his charge of
protector. The commons indeed were determined to bear no delay. As if
ignorant of what had been resolved in consequence of their second request,
they urged it a third time, on the next day of meeting; and received for
answer that "the king our said sovereign lord, by the advice and assent of
his lords spiritual and temporal being in this present parliament, had
named and desired the duke of York to be protector and defensor of this
land." It is worthy of notice that in these words, and indeed in effect,
as appears by the whole transaction, the house of peers assumed an
exclusive right of choosing the protector, though, in the act passed to
ratify their election, the commons' assent, as a matter of course, is
introduced. The last year's precedent was followed in the present
instance, excepting a remarkable deviation; instead of the words "during
the king's pleasure," the duke was to hold his office "until he should be
discharged of it by the lords in
parliament."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>This extraordinary clause, and the slight allegations on which it was
thought fit to substitute a vicegerent for the reigning monarch, are
sufficient to prove, even if the common historians were silent, that
whatever passed as to this second protectorate of the duke of York was
altogether of a revolutionary complexion. In the actual circumstances of
civil blood already spilled and the king in captivity, we may justly
wonder that so much regard was shown to the regular forms and precedents
of the constitution. But the duke's natural moderation will account for
part of this, and the temper of the lords for much more. That assembly
appears for the most part to have been faithfully attached to the house of
Lancaster. The partisans of Richard were found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the commons and among
the populace. Several months elapsed after the victory of St. Albans
before an attempt was thus made to set aside a sovereign, not labouring,
so far as we know, under any more notorious infirmity than before. It then
originated in the commons, and seems to have received but an unwilling
consent from the upper house. Even in constituting the duke of York
protector over the head of Henry, whom all men despaired of ever seeing in
a state to face the dangers of such a season, the lords did not forget the
rights of his son. By this latter instrument, as well as by that of the
preceding year, the duke's office was to cease upon the prince of Wales
arriving at the age of discretion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duke of York's claim to the crown.</div>

<p>But what had long been propagated in secret, soon became familiar to the
public ear; that the duke of York laid claim to the throne. He was
unquestionably heir general of the royal line, through his mother, Anne,
daughter of Roger Mortimer earl of March, son of Philippa, daughter of
Lionel duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III. Roger Mortimer's eldest
son, Edmund, had been declared heir presumptive by Richard II.; but his
infancy during the revolution that placed Henry IV. on the throne had
caused his pretensions to be passed over in silence. The new king however
was induced by a jealousy natural to his situation to detain the earl of
March in custody. Henry V. restored his liberty; and, though he had
certainly connived for a while at the conspiracy planned by his
brother-in-law the earl of Cambridge and Lord Scrope of Masham to place
the crown on his head, that magnanimous prince gave him a free pardon, and
never testified any displeasure. The present duke of York was honoured by
Henry VI. with the highest trusts in France and Ireland; such as Beaufort
and Gloucester could never have dreamed of conferring on him if his title
to the crown had not been reckoned obsolete. It has been very pertinently
remarked that the crime perpetrated by Margaret and her counsellors in the
death of the duke of Gloucester was the destruction of the house of
Lancaster.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
this time the duke of York, next heir in presumption
while the king was childless, might innocently contemplate the prospect of
royalty; and when such ideas had long been passing through his mind, we
may judge how reluctantly the birth of prince Edward, nine years after
Henry's marriage, would be admitted to disturb them. The queen's
administration unpopular, careless of national interests, and partial to
his inveterate enemy the duke of
Somerset;<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
the king incapable of
exciting fear or respect; himself conscious of powerful alliances and
universal favour; all these circumstances combined could hardly fail to
nourish those opinions of hereditary right which he must have imbibed from
his infancy.</p>

<p>The duke of York preserved through the critical season of rebellion such
moderation and humanity that we may pardon him that bias in favour of his
own pretensions to which he became himself a victim. Margaret perhaps, by
her sanguinary violence in the Coventry parliament of 1460, where the duke
and all his adherents were attainted, left him not the choice of remaining
a subject with impunity. But with us, who are to weigh these ancient
factions in the balance of wisdom and justice, there should be no
hesitation in deciding that the house of Lancaster were lawful sovereigns
of England. I am, indeed, astonished that not only such historians as
Carte, who wrote undisguisedly upon a Jacobite system, but even men of
juster principles, have been inadvertent enough to mention the right of
the house of York. If the original consent of the nation, if three
descents of the crown, if repeated acts of parliament, if oaths of
allegiance from the whole kingdom, and more particularly from those who
now advanced a contrary pretension, if undisturbed, unquestioned
possession during sixty years, could not secure the reigning family
against a mere defect in their genealogy, when were the people to expect
tranquillity? Sceptres were committed, and governments were instituted,
for public protection and public happiness, not certainly for the benefit
of rulers, or for the security of particular dynasties. No prejudice has
less in its favour, and none has been more fatal to the peace of mankind,
than that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
which regards a nation of subjects as a family's private
inheritance. For, as this opinion induces reigning princes and their
courtiers to look on the people as made only to obey them, so, when the
tide of events has swept them from their thrones, it begets a fond hope of
restoration, a sense of injury and of imprescriptible rights, which give
the show of justice to fresh disturbances of public order, and rebellions
against established authority. Even in cases of unjust conquest, which are
far stronger than any domestic revolution, time heals the injury of
wounded independence, the forced submission to a victorious enemy is
changed into spontaneous allegiance to a sovereign, and the laws of God
and nature enjoin the obedience that is challenged by reciprocal benefits.
But far more does every national government, however violent in its
origin, become legitimate, when universally obeyed and justly exercised,
the possession drawing after it the right; not certainly that success can
alter the moral character of actions, or privilege usurpation before the
tribunal of human opinion, or in the pages of history, but that the
recognition of a government by the people is the binding pledge of their
allegiance so long as its corresponding duties are
fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> And
thus the law of England has been held to annex the subject's fidelity to
the reigning monarch, by whatever title he may have ascended the throne,
and whoever else may be its
claimant.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
But the statute of 11th of
Henry VII. c. 1, has furnished an unequivocal commentary upon this
principle, when, alluding to the condemnations and forfeitures by which
those alternate successes of the white and red roses had almost exhausted
the noble blood of England, it enacts that "no man for doing true and
faithful service to the king for the time being be convict or attaint of
high treason, nor of other offences, by act of parliament or otherwise."</p>

<div class="sidenote">War of the Lancastrians and Yorkists.</div>

<p>Though all classes of men and all parts of England were divided into
factions by this unhappy contest, yet the strength of the Yorkists lay in
London and the neighbouring counties, and generally among the middling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and lower people. And this is what might naturally be expected. For
notions of hereditary right take easy hold of the populace, who feel an
honest sympathy for those whom they consider as injured; while men of
noble birth and high station have a keener sense of personal duty to their
sovereign, and of the baseness of deserting their allegiance.
Notwithstanding the wide-spreading influence of the Nevils, most of the
nobility were well affected to the reigning dynasty. We have seen how
reluctantly they acquiesced in the second protectorate of the duke of York
after the battle of St. Albans. Thirty-two temporal peers took an oath of
fealty to Henry and his issue in the Coventry parliament of 1460, which
attainted the duke of York and the earls of Warwick and
Salisbury.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
And in the memorable circumstances of the duke's claim personally made in
parliament, it seems manifest that the lords complied not only with
hesitation but unwillingness, and in fact testified their respect and duty
for Henry by confirming the crown to him during his
life.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> The rose of
Lancaster blushed upon the banners of the Staffords, the Percies, the
Veres, the Hollands, and the Courtneys. All these illustrious families lay
crushed for a time under the ruins of their party. But the course of
fortune, which has too great a mastery over crowns and sceptres to be
controlled by men's affection, invested Edward IV. with a possession which
the general consent of the nation both sanctioned and secured. This was
effected in no slight degree by the furious spirit of Margaret, who began
a system of extermination by acts of attainder and execution of prisoners
that created abhorrence, though it did not prevent imitation. And the
barbarities of her northern army, whom she led towards London after the
battle of Wakefield, lost the Lancastrian cause its former
friends,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
and might justly convince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
reflecting men that it were better to risk the
chances of a new dynasty than trust the kingdom to an exasperated faction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward IV.</div>

<p>A period of obscurity and confusion ensues, during which we have as little
insight into constitutional as general history. There are no contemporary
chroniclers of any value, and the rolls of parliament, by whose light we
have hitherto steered, become mere registers of private bills, or of
petitions relating to commerce. The reign of Edward IV. is the first
during which no statute was passed for the redress of grievances or
maintenance of the subject's liberty. Nor is there, if I am correct, a
single petition of this nature upon the roll. Whether it were that the
commons had lost too much of their ancient courage to present any
remonstrances, or that a wilful omission has vitiated the record, is hard
to determine; but we certainly must not imagine that a government cemented
with blood poured on the scaffold, as well as in the field, under a
passionate and unprincipled sovereign, would afford no scope for the just
animadversion of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
The reign of Edward IV. was a reign of
terror. One half of the noble families had been thinned by proscription;
and though generally restored in blood by the reversal of their
attainders&mdash;a measure certainly deserving of much approbation&mdash;were still
under the eyes of vigilant and inveterate enemies. The opposite faction
would be cautious how they resisted a king of their own creation, while
the hopes of their adversaries were only dormant. And indeed, without
relying on this supposition, it is commonly seen that, when temporary
circumstances have given a king the means of acting in disregard of his
subjects' privileges, it is a very difficult undertaking for them to
recover a liberty which has no security so effectual as habitual
possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Besides the severe proceedings against the Lancastrian party, which might
be extenuated by the common pretences, retaliation of similar
proscriptions, security for the actual government, or just punishment of
rebellion against a legitimate heir, there are several reputed instances
of violence and barbarity in the reign of Edward IV. which have not such
plausible excuses. Every one knows the common stories of the citizen who
was attainted of treason for an idle speech that he would make his son
heir to the crown, the house where he dwelt; and of Thomas Burdett, who
wished the horns of his stag in the belly of him who had advised the king
to shoot it. Of the former I can assert nothing, though I do not believe
it to be accurately reported. But certainly the accusation against
Burdett, however iniquitous, was not confined to these frivolous words;
which indeed do not appear in his
indictment,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
or in a passage
relative to his conviction in the roll of parliament. Burdett was a
servant and friend of the duke of Clarence, and sacrificed as a
preliminary victim. It was an article of charge against Clarence that he
had attempted to persuade the people that "Thomas Burdett his servant,
which was lawfully and truly attainted of treason, was wrongfully put to
death."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
There could indeed be no more oppressive usage inflicted upon
meaner persons than this attainder of the duke of Clarence&mdash;an act for
which a brother could not be pardoned had he been guilty, and which
deepens the shadow of a tyrannical age, if, as it seems, his offence
toward Edward was but levity and rashness.</p>

<p>But whatever acts of injustice we may attribute, from authority or
conjecture, to Edward's government, it was very far from being unpopular.
His love of pleasure, his affability, his courage and beauty, gave him a
credit with his subjects which he had no real virtue to challenge. This
restored him to the throne, even against the prodigious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
influence of Warwick, and compelled Henry VII. to treat his memory with respect, and
acknowledge him as a lawful
king.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
The latter years of his reign were
passed in repose at home after scenes of unparalleled convulsions, and in
peace abroad after more than a century of expensive warfare. His demands
of subsidy were therefore moderate, and easily defrayed by a nation which
was making rapid advances towards opulence. According to Sir John
Fortescue, nearly one fifth of the whole kingdom had come to the king's
hand by forfeiture at some time or other since the commencement of his
reign.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
Many indeed of these lands had been restored, and others
lavished away in grants, but the surplus revenue must still have been
considerable.</p>

<p>Edward IV. was the first who practised a new method of taking his
subjects' money without consent of parliament, under the plausible name of
benevolences. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
came in place of the still more plausible loans of
former monarchs, and were principally levied on the wealthy traders.
Though no complaint appears in the parliamentary records of his reign,
which, as has been observed, complain of nothing, the illegality was
undoubtedly felt and resented. In the remarkable address to Richard by
that tumultuary meeting which invited him to assume the crown, we find,
among general assertions of the state's decay through misgovernment, the
following strong passage:&mdash;"For certainly we be determined rather to
aventure and committe us to the perill of owre lyfs and jopardie of deth,
than to lyve in such thraldome and bondage as we have lyved long tyme
heretofore, oppressed and injured by extortions and newe impositions
ayenst the lawes of God and man, and the libertie, old policie, and lawes
of this realme, whereyn every Englishman is
inherited."<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Accordingly, in Richard III.'s only parliament an act was passed which, after reciting
in the strongest terms the grievances lately endured, abrogates and annuls
for ever all exactions under the name of
benevolence.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
The liberties of this country were at least not directly impaired by the usurpation of
Richard. But from an act so deeply tainted with moral guilt, as well as so
violent in all its circumstances, no substantial benefit was likely to
spring. Whatever difficulty there may be in deciding upon the fate of
Richard's nephews after they were immured in the Tower, the more public
parts of the transaction bear unequivocal testimony to his ambitious
usurpation.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
It would therefore be foreign to the purpose of this
chapter to dwell upon his assumption of the regency, or upon the sort of
election, however curious and remarkable, which gave a pretended authority
to his usurpation of the throne. Neither of these has ever been alleged by
any party in the way of constitutional precedent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

<p>At this epoch I terminate these inquiries into the English constitution; a
sketch very imperfect, I fear, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
unsatisfactory, but which may at least
answer the purpose of fixing the reader's attention on the principal
objects, and of guiding him to the purest fountains of constitutional
knowledge. From the accession of the house of Tudor a new period is to be
dated in our history, far more prosperous in the diffusion of opulence and
the preservation of general order than the preceding, but less
distinguished by the spirit of freedom and jealousy of tyrannical power.
We have seen, through the twilight of our Anglo-Saxon records, a form of
civil policy established by our ancestors, marked, like the kindred
governments of the continent, with aboriginal Teutonic features; barbarous
indeed, and insufficient for the great ends of society, but capable and
worthy of the improvement it has received, because actuated by a sound and
vital spirit, the love of freedom and of justice. From these principles
arose that venerable institution, which none but a free and simple people
could have conceived, trial by peers&mdash;an institution common in some degree
to other nations, but which, more widely extended, more strictly retained,
and better modified among ourselves, has become perhaps the first,
certainly among the first, of our securities against arbitrary government.
We have seen a foreign conqueror and his descendants trample almost alike
upon the prostrate nation and upon those who had been companions of their
victory, introduce the servitudes of feudal law with more than their usual
rigour, and establish a large revenue by continual precedents upon a
system of universal and prescriptive extortion. But the Norman and English
races, each unfit to endure oppression, forgetting their animosities in a
common interest, enforce by arms the concession of a great charter of
liberties. Privileges wrested from one faithless monarch are preserved
with continual vigilance against the machinations of another; the rights
of the people become more precise, and their spirit more magnanimous,
during the long reign of Henry III. With greater ambition and greater
abilities than his father, Edward I. attempts in vain to govern in an
arbitrary manner, and has the mortification of seeing his prerogative
fettered by still more important limitations. The great council of the
nation is opened to the representatives of the commons. They proceed by
slow and cautious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
steps to remonstrate against public grievances, to
check the abuses of administration, and sometimes to chastise public
delinquency in the officers of the crown. A number of remedial provisions
are added to the statutes; every Englishman learns to remember that he is
the citizen of a free state, and to claim the common law as his
birthright, even though the violence of power should interrupt its
enjoyment. It were a strange misrepresentation of history to assert that
the constitution had attained anything like a perfect state in the
fifteenth century; but I know not whether there are any essential
privileges of our countrymen, any fundamental securities against arbitrary
power, so far as they depend upon positive institution, which may not be
traced to the time when the house of Plantagenet filled the English
throne.</p>

Edward would not confirm the charters, notwithstanding his
promise, without the words, salvo jure coron√¶ nostr√¶; on which the two
earls retired from court. When the confirmation was read to the people at
St. Paul's, says Hemingford, they blessed the king on seeing the charters
with the great seal affixed; but when they heard the captious conclusion,
they cursed him instead. At the next meeting of parliament, the king
agreed to omit these insidious words, p. 168.</p></div>

The supposed statute, De Tallagio non concedendo, is
considered by Blackstone (Introduction to Charters, p. 67) as merely an
abstract of the Confirmatio Chartarum. By that entitled Articuli super
Chartas, 28 Edw. I., a court was erected in every county, of three knights
or others, to be elected by the commons of the shire, whose sole province
was to determine offences against the two charters, with the power of
punishing by fine and imprisonment; but not to extend to any case wherein
a remedy by writ was already provided. The Confirmatio Chartarum is
properly denominated a statute, and always printed as such; but in form,
like Magna Charta, it is a charter, or letters patent, proceeding from the
crown, without even reciting the consent of the realm. And its "teste" is
at Ghent, 2 Nov. 1297; Edward having engaged, conjointly with the count of
Flanders, in a war with Philip the Fair. But a parliament had been held at
London, when the barons insisted on these concessions. The circumstances
are not wholly unlike those of Magna Charta.
</p><p>
The Lords' Committee do not seem to reject the statute "de tallagio non
concedendo" altogether, but say that, "if the manuscript containing it (in
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge) is a true copy of a statute, it is
undoubtedly a copy of a statute of the 25th, and not of a statute of the
34th of Edward I." p. 230. It seems to me on comparing the two, that the
supposed statute de tallagio is but an imperfect transcript of the king's
charter at Ghent. But at least, as one exists in an authentic form, and
the other is only found in an unauthorized copy, there can be no question
which ought to be quoted.</p></div>

Hody (Treatise on Convocations, p. 126) states the matter
thus: in the Saxon times all bishops and abbots sat and voted in the state
councils, or parliament, as such, and not on account of their tenures.
After the Conquest the abbots sat there not as such, but by virtue of
their tenures, as barons; and the bishops sat in a double capacity, as
bishops, and as barons.</p></div>

of the spurious laws of Edward the Confessor; and I have been accused of
passing it over too slightly. The fact certainly does not rest on the
authority of Hoveden, who transcribes these laws <i>verbatim</i>; and they are
in substance an ancient document. There seems to me somewhat rather
suspicious in this assembly of delegates; it looks like a pious fraud to
maintain the old Saxon jurisprudence, which was giving way. But even if we
admit the fact as here told, I still adhere to the assertion that there is
no appearance that these twelve deputies of each county were invested with
any higher authority than that of declaring their ancient usages. Any
supposition of a real legislative parliament would be inconsistent with
all that we know of the state of England under the Conqueror. And what an
anomaly, upon every constitutional principle, Anglo-Saxon or Norman, would
be a parliament of twelve from each county! Nor is it perfectly manifest
that they were chosen by the people; the word summoneri fecit is first
used; and afterwards, electis de (not <i>in</i>) singulis totius patri√¶
comitatibus. This might be construed of the king's selection; but perhaps
the common interpretation is rather the better.
</p><p>
William, the compiler informs us, having heard some of the Danish laws,
was disposed to confirm them in preference to those of England; but
yielded to the supplication of the delegates, omnes compatriot√¶, qui leges
narraverant, that he would permit them to retain the customs of their
ancestors, imploring him by the soul of King Edward, cujus erant leges,
nec aliorum exterorum. The king at length gave way, by the advice and
request of his barons, consilio et precatu baronum. These of course were
Normans; but what inference can be drawn in favour of parliamentary
representation in England from the behaviour of the rest? They were
supplicants, not legislators.</p></div>

of these writs implies a distinction between such as were styled barons,
apparently including the earls and the four knights who were to come from
the several counties ad loquendum, and who were also distinguished from
the knights summoned to attend with arms, in performance, it should seem,
of the military service due by their respective tenures; and the writs,
therefore, apparently distinguished certain tenants in chief by
knight-service from barons, if the knights so summoned to attend with arms
were required to attend by reason of their respective tenures in chief of
the king. How the four knights of each county who were thus summoned to
confer with the king were to be chosen, whether by the county, or
according to the mere will of the sheriff, does not appear; but it seems
most probable that they were intended by the king as representatives of
the freeholders of each county, and to balance the power of the hostile
nobles, who were then leagued against him; and the measure might lead to
conciliate the minds of those who would otherwise have had no voice in the
legislative assembly." Report of Lords' Committee, p. 61.
</p><p>
This would be a remarkable fact, and the motive is by no means improbable,
being perhaps that which led to the large provisions for summoning tenants
in chief, contained in the charter of John, and afterwards passed over.
But this parley of the four knights from each county, for they are only
summoned ad loquendum, may not amount to bestowing on them any legislative
power. It is nevertheless to be remembered that the word parliament meant,
by its etymology, nothing more; and the words, ad loquendum, may have been
used in reference to that. It is probable that these writs were not
obeyed; we have no evidence that they were, and it was a season of great
confusion very little before the granting of the charter of Henry III.</p></div>

resident proprietors, called Lagemanni, had jurisdiction (socam et sacam)
over their tenants. But nowhere have I been able to discover any trace of
municipal self-government; unless Chester may be deemed an exception,
where we read of twelve judices civitatis; but by whom constituted does
not appear. The word lageman seems equivalent to judex. The guild
mentioned above at Canterbury was, in all probability, a voluntary
association: so at Dover we find the burgesses' guildhall, gihalla
burgensium. p. 1.

Many of the passages in Domesday relative to the state of burgesses are
collected in Brady's History of Boroughs; a work which, if read with due
suspicion of the author's honesty, will convey a great deal of knowledge.
</p><p>
Since the former part of this note was written, I have met with a charter
granted by Henry II. to Lincoln, which seems to refer, more explicitly
than any similar instrument, to municipal privileges of jurisdiction
enjoyed by the citizens under Edward the Confessor. These charters, it is
well known, do not always recite what is true; yet it is possible that the
citizens of Lincoln, which had been one of the five Danish towns,
sometimes mentioned with a sort of distinction by writers before the
Conquest, might be in a more advantageous situation than the generality of
burgesses. Sciatis me concessisse civibus meis Lincoln, omnes libertates
et consuetudines et leges suas, quas habuerunt tempore Edwardi et Will. et
Henr. regum Angli√¶, et gildam suam mercatoriam de hominibus civitatis et
de aliis mercatoribus comitatus, sicut illam habuerunt tempore

40 (edit. 1816).
</p><p>
I am indebted to the friendly remarks of the periodical critic whom I have
before mentioned for reminding me of other charters of the same age,
expressed in a similar manner, which in my haste I had overlooked, though
printed in common books. But whether these general words ought to outweigh
the silence of Domesday Book I am not prepared to decide. I have admitted
below that the possession of corporate property implies an elective
government for its administration, and I think it perfectly clear that the
guilds made by-laws for the regulation of their members. Yet this is
something different from municipal jurisdiction over all the inhabitants
of a town. [<a href="#N4"><span class="smcap">Note</span> IV.</a>]</p></div>

But the instrument itself, which is only preserved by an Inspeximus of

Could it be traced so high, the circumstance would be remarkable, as the
earliest charters granted by Louis VI., supposed to be the father of these
institutions, are several years later.
</p><p>
It is said by Mr. Thorpe (Ancient Laws of England, p. 267), that, though
there are ten witnesses, he only finds one who throws any light on the
date: namely, Hugh Bigod, who succeeded his brother William in 1120. But
Mr. Thorpe does not mention in what respect he succeeded. It was as
<i>dapifer regis</i>; but he is not so named in the charter. Dugdale's
Baronage, p. 132. The date, therefore, still seems problematical.</p></div>

fellowship among the thanes of Cambridgeshire, containing several curious
particulars. A composition of eight pounds, exclusive, I conceive, of the
usual weregild, was to be enforced from the slayer of any fellow. If a
fellow (gilda) killed a man of 1200 shillings weregild, each of the
society was to contribute half a marc; for a ceorl, two or√¶ (perhaps ten
shillings); for a Welshman, one. If however this act was committed
wantonly, the fellow had no right to call on the society for contribution.
If one fellow killed another, he was to pay the legal weregild to his
kindred, and also eight pounds to the society. Harsh words used by one
fellow towards another, or even towards a stranger, incurred a fine. No
one was to eat or drink in the company of one who had killed his brother
fellow, unless in the presence of the king, bishop, or alderman.

We find in Wilkins's Anglo-Saxon Laws, p. 65, a number of ordinances sworn
to by persons both of noble and ignoble rank (ge eorlisce ge ceorlisce),
and confirmed by king Athelstan. These are in the nature of by-laws for
the regulation of certain societies that had been formed for the
preservation of public order. Their remedy was rather violent: to kill and
seize the effects of all who should rob any member of the association.
This property, after deducting the value of the things stolen, was to be
divided into two parts; one given to the criminal's wife if not an
accomplice, the other shared between the king and the society.
</p><p>
In another fraternity among the clergy and laity of Exeter every fellow
was entitled to a contribution in case of taking a journey, or if his
house was burned. Thus they resembled, in some degree, our friendly
societies; and display an interesting picture of manners, which has
induced me to insert this note, though not greatly to the present purpose.

A singular proof of the estimation in which the citizens of London held
themselves in the reign of Richard I. occurs in the Chronicle of Jocelyn
de Brakelonde (p. 56&mdash;Camden Society, 1840). They claimed to be free from
toll in every part of England, and in every jurisdiction, resting their
immunity on the antiquity of London (which was coeval, they said, with
Rome), and on its rank as metropolis of the kingdom. Et dicebant cives
Lundonienses fuisse quietos de theloneo in omni foro, et semper et ubique,
per totam Angliam, √† tempore quo Roma primo fundata fuit, et civitatem
Lundoni√¶, eodem tempore fundatam, talem debere habere libertatem per totam
Angliam, et ratione civitatis privilegiat√¶ qu√¶ olim metropolis fuit et
caput regni, et ratione antiquitatis. Palgrave inclines to think that
London never formed part of any kingdom of the Heptarchy. Introduction to
Rot. Cur. Regis. p. 95. But this seems to imply a republican city in the
midst of so many royal states, which seems hardly probable. Certainly it
seems strange, though I cannot explain it away, that the capital of
England should have fallen, as we generally suppose, to the small and
obscure kingdom of Essex. Winchester, indeed, may be considered as having
become afterwards the capital during the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, so far as
that it was for the most part the residence of our kings. But London was
always more populous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[n]</span></a> Drake, the historian of York, maintains that London was less
populous, about the time of the Conquest, than that city; and quotes
Hardynge, a writer of Henry V.'s age, to prove that the interior part of
the former was not closely built. Eboracum, p. 91. York however does not
appear to have contained more than 10,000 inhabitants at the accession of
the Conqueror; and the very exaggerations as to the populousness of London
prove that it must have far exceeded that number. Fitz-Stephen, the
contemporary biographer of Thomas √† Becket, tells us of 80,000 men capable
of bearing arms within its precincts; where however his translator, Pegge,
suspects a mistake of the MS. in the numerals. And this, with similar
hyperboles, so imposed on the judicious mind of Lord Lyttelton, that,
finding in Peter of Blois the inhabitants of London reckoned at
quadraginta millia, he has actually proposed to read quadringenta. Hist.
Henry II., vol. iv. ad finem. It is hardly necessary to observe that the
condition of agriculture and internal communication would not have allowed
half that number to subsist.
</p><p>
The subsidy-roll of 1377, published in the Arch√¶ologia, vol. vii., would
lead to a conclusion that all the inhabitants of London did not even then
exceed 35,000. If this be true, they could not have amounted, probably, to
so great a number two or three centuries earlier. But the numbers given in
that document have been questioned as to Norwich upon very plausible
grounds, and seem rather suspicious in the present instance. [<a href="#N5"><span class="smcap">Note</span> V.</a>]</p></div>

Committee, p. 191. The enactment by the king and council founded on the
consent of the estates was at Acton Burnell. And the Statute of Merchants,
13 Edw. I., refers to that of the 11th, as made by the king, a son
parlement que il tint √† Acton Burnell, and again mentions l'avant dit
statut fait √† Acton Burnell. This seems to afford a voucher for what is
said in my text, which has been controverted by a learned antiquary.[*] It
is certain that the lords were at Shrewsbury in their judicial character
condemning Llewellin; but whether they proceeded afterwards to Acton
Burnell, and joined in the statute, is not quite so clear.

afford some ground for hesitation, if the royal burghs of Scotland were
actually represented in their parliament more than half a century before
the date assigned to the first representation of English towns. Lord
Hailes concludes from a passage in Fordun "that as early as 1211 burgesses
gave suit and presence in the great council of the king's vassals; though
the contrary has been asserted with much confidence by various authors."
Annals of Scotland, vol. i. p. 139. Fordun's words, however, so far from
importing that they formed a member of the legislature, which perhaps Lord
Hailes did not mean by the quaint expression "gave suit and presence," do
not appear to me conclusive to prove that they were actually present. Hoc
anno Rex Scoti√¶ Willelmus magnum tenuit consilium. Ubi, petito ab
optimatibus auxilio, promiserunt se daturos decem mille marcas: pr√¶ter
burgenses regni, qui sex millia promiserunt. Those who know the brief and
incorrect style of chronicles will not think it unlikely that the offer of
6000 marks by the burgesses was not made in parliament, but in consequence
of separate requisitions from the crown. Pinkerton is of opinion that the
magistrates of royal burghs might upon this, and perhaps other occasions,
have attended at the bar of parliament with their offers of money. But the
deputies of towns do not appear as a part of parliament till 1326. Hist.

It has been observed that this provision "had probably in view the
administration of justice by the king's court in parliament." Report of L.
C. p. 301. And in another place:&mdash;"It is clear that the word parliament in
the reign of Edward I. was not used only to describe a legislative
assembly, but was the common appellation of the ordinary assembly of the
king's great court or council; and that the legislative assembly of the
realm, composed generally, in and after the 23rd of Edward I., of lords
spiritual and temporal, and representatives of the commons, was usually
convened to meet the king's council in one of these parliaments." p. 171.
</p><p>
Certainly the commons could not desire to have an annual parliament in
order to make new statutes, much less to grant subsidies. It was, however,
important to present their petitions, and to set forth their grievances to
this high court. We may easily reconcile the anxiety so often expressed by
the commons to have frequent sessions of parliament, with the individual
reluctance of members to attend. A few active men procured these
petitions, which the majority could not with decency oppose, since the
public benefit was generally admitted. But when the writs came down, every
pretext was commonly made use of to avoid a troublesome and
ill-remunerated journey to Westminster. For the subject of annual
parliaments see a valuable article by Allen in the 28th volume of the
Edinburgh Review.</p></div>

is recited&mdash;Come le seizieme jour de Marz l'an de notre regne tierce, a

this passage in the roll of parliament, that "the king's right to tallage
his cities, boroughs, and demesnes seems not to have been questioned by
the parliament, though the commissions for setting the tallage were
objected to." p. 305. But how can we believe that after the
representatives of these cities and boroughs had sat, at least at times,
for two reigns, and after the explicit renunciation of all right of
tallage by Edward I. (for it was never pretended that the king could lay a
tallage on any towns which did not hold of himself), there could have been
a parliament which "did not question" the legality of a tallage set
without their consent? The silence of the rolls of parliament would
furnish but a poor argument. But in fact their language is expressive
enough. The several ranks of lords and commons grant the fifteenth penny
from the commonalty, and the tenth from the cities, boroughs, and demesnes
of the king, "that our lord the king may live of his own, and pay for his
expenses, and not aggrieve his people by excessive (outraiouses) prises,
or otherwise." And upon this the king revokes the commission in the words
of the text. Can anything be clearer than that the parliament, though in a
much gentler tone than they came afterwards to assume, intimate the
illegality of the late tallage? As to any other objection to the
commissions, which the committee suppose to have been taken, nothing
appears on the roll.</p></div>

Originally two chief taxors were appointed by the king for each county,
who named twelve persons in every hundred to assess the moveable estate of
all inhabitants according to its real value. But in 8 E. III., on
complaint of parliament that these taxors were partial, commissioners were
sent round to compound with every town and parish for a gross sum, which
was from thenceforth the fixed quota of subsidy, and raised by the
inhabitants themselves. Brady on Boroughs, p. 81.</p></div>

statutes made two years before be maintained in their force, having

blemish of his crown and royalty, and against the law of the land in many
points, he had repealed it. But he would have the articles of the said
statute examined, and what should be found honourable and profitable to

to this passage of Knyghton, as to the main facts; and perhaps even the
speech of Gloucester and the bishop of Ely is more likely to have been
made public by them than invented by so jejune an historian. Walsingham
indeed says nothing of the matter; but he is so unequally informed and so
frequently defective, that we can draw no strong inference from his
silence. What most weighs with me is that parliament met on Oct. 1, 1387,
and was not dissolved till Nov. 28; a longer period than the business done
in it seems to have required; and also that Suffolk, who opened the
session as chancellor, is styled "darrein chancellor" in the articles of
impeachment against him; so that he must have been removed in the
interval, which tallies with Knyghton's story. Besides, it is plain, from
the famous questions subsequently put by the king to his judges at
Nottingham, that both the right of retiring without a regular dissolution,
and the precedent of Edward II., had been discussed in parliament, which
does not appear anywhere else than in Knyghton.</p></div>

for the continuance of sheriffs beyond a year, and grounds upon this
mistake part of his defence of Richard II. (Note to vol. ii. p. 270, 4to.
edit.) For this he refers to Cotton's Abridgment; whether rightly or not I
cannot say, being little acquainted with that inaccurate book, upon which
it is unfortunate that Hume relied so much. The passage from Walsingham in
the same note is also wholly perverted; as the reader will discover
without further observation. An historian must be strangely warped who
quotes a passage explicitly complaining of illegal acts in order to infer
that those very acts were legal.</p></div>

if he had only received the tonsure. But it seems that he was actually in
orders; for the record calls him Sir Thomas Haxey, a title at that time
regularly given to the parson of a parish. If this be so, it is a
remarkable authority for the clergy's capacity of sitting in parliament.</p></div>

that his sentence was en aneantissement des custumes de la commune, p.
434. His judgment was reversed by both houses, as having passed de volont√©

attentively at the passages relative to Haxey that he was a member of
parliament; though this was questioned a few years ago by the committee of
the house of commons, who made a report on the right of the clergy to be
elected; a right which, I am inclined to believe, did exist down to the
Reformation, as the grounds alleged for Nowell's expulsion in the first,
of Mary, besides this instance of Haxey conspire to prove, though it has
since been lost by disuse.</p></div>

against Richard in the following terms: Item, in parliamento ultimo
celebrato apud Salopiam, idem rex proponens opprimere populum suum
procuravit subtiliter et fecit concedi, quod potestas parliamenti de
consensu omnium statuum regni sui remaneret apud quasdam certas personas
ad terminandum, dissoluto parliamento, certas petitiones in eodem
parliamento porrectas protunc minim√® expeditas. Cujus concessionis colore
person√¶ sic deputat√¶ processerunt ad alia generaliter parliamentum illud

Whether the last accusation, of altering the parliamentary roll, be true
or not, there is enough left in it to prove everything I have asserted in
the text. From this it is sufficiently manifest how unfairly Carte and
Hume have drawn a parallel between this self-deputed legislative
commission and that appointed by parliament to reform the administration
eleven years before.</p></div>

narrative of these proceedings in the Rolls of Parliament, vol. iii. p.
382. It appears that Mowbray was the most offending party, since,
independently of Hereford's accusation, he is charged with openly
maintaining the appeals made in the false parliament of the eleventh of
the king. But the banishment of his accuser was wholly unjustifiable by
any motives that we can discover. It is strange that Carte should express
surprise at the sentence upon the duke of Norfolk, while he seems to
consider that upon Hereford as very equitable. But he viewed the whole of
this reign, and of those that ensued, with the jaundiced eye of
Jacobitism.</p></div>

Perhaps the triple division of our legislature may be dated from this
innovation. For as it is impossible to deny that, while the king
promulgated a statute founded upon a mere petition, he was himself the
real legislator, so I think it is equally fair to assert, notwithstanding
the formal preamble of our statutes, that laws brought into either house
of parliament in a perfect shape, and receiving first the assent of lords
and commons, and finally that of the king, who has no power to modify
them, must be deemed to proceed, and derive their efficacy, from the joint
concurrence of all the three. It is said, indeed, at a much earlier time,
that le ley de la terre est fait en parlement par le roi, et les seigneurs
espirituels et temporels, et tout la communaut√© du royaume. Rot. Parl.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_244_244" id="Footnote_244_244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_244_244"><span class="label">[b]</span></a> A notion is entertained by many people, and not without the
authority of some very respectable names, that the king is one of the
three estates of the realm, the lords spiritual and temporal forming
together the second, as the commons in parliament do the third. This is
contradicted by the general tenor of our ancient records and law-books;
and indeed the analogy of other governments ought to have the greatest
weight, even if more reason for doubt appeared upon the face of our own
authorities. But the instances where the three estates are declared or
implied to be the nobility, clergy, and commons, or at least their
representatives in parliament, are too numerous for insertion. This land
standeth, says the Chancellor Stillington, in 7th Edward IV., by three
states, and above that one principal, that is to wit, lords spiritual,
lords temporal, and commons, and over that, state royal, as our sovereign
lord the king. Rot. Parl. vol. v. p. 622. Thus, too, it is declared that
the treaty of Staples in 1492 was to be confirmed per tres status regni
Angli√¶ rit√® et debit√® convocatos, videlicet per prelatos et clerum,
nobiles et communitates ejusdem regni. Rymer, t. xii. p. 508.
</p><p>
I will not, however, suppress one passage, and the only instance that has
occurred in my reading, where the king does appear to have been reckoned
among the three estates. The commons say, in the 2nd of Henry IV., that
the states of the realm may be compared to a trinity, that is, the king,
the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons. Rot. Parl. vol. iii. p.
459. In this expression, however, the sense shows that by estates of the
realm they meant members, or necessary parts, of the parliament.
</p><p>
Whitelocke, on the Parliamentary Writ, vol. ii. p. 43, argues at length,
that the three estates are king, lords, and commons, which seems to have
been a current doctrine among the popular lawyers of the seventeenth
century. His reasoning is chiefly grounded on the baronial tenure of
bishops, the validity of acts passed against their consent, and other
arguments of the same kind; which might go to prove that there are only at
present two estates, but can never turn the king into one.
</p><p>
The source of this error is an inattention to the primary sense of the
word estate (status), which means an order or condition into which men are
classed by the institutions of society. It is only in a secondary, or
rather an elliptical application, that it can be referred to their
representatives in parliament or national councils. The lords temporal,
indeed, of England are identical with the estate of the nobility; but the
house of commons is not, strictly speaking, the estate of commonalty, to
which its members belong, and from which they are deputed. So the whole
body of the clergy are properly speaking one of the estates, and are
described as such in the older authorities, 21 Ric. II. Rot. Parl. vol.
iii. p. 348, though latterly the lords spiritual in parliament acquired,
with less correctness, that appellation. Hody on Convocations, p. 426. The
bishops, indeed, may be said, constructively, to represent the whole of
the clergy, with whose grievances they are supposed to be best acquainted,
and whose rights it is their peculiar duty to defend. And I do not find
that the inferior clergy had any other representation in the cortes of
Castile and Aragon, where the ecclesiastical order was always counted
among the estates of the realm.</p></div>

alterations in a bill sent up to them from the commons, even if it related

embraced by Prynne, is, I confess, much opposed to general opinion; and a
very respectable living writer treats such an interpretation of the
statute 7 H. IV. as chimerical. The words cited in the text, "as others,"
mean only, according to him, suitors not duly summoned. Heywood on
Elections, vol. i. p. 20. But, as I presume, the summons to freeholders
was by general proclamation; so that it is not easy to perceive what
difference there could be between summoned and unsummoned suitors. And if
the words are supposed to glance at the private summonses to a few
friends, by means of which the sheriffs were accustomed to procure a
clandestine election, one can hardly imagine that such persons would be
styled "duly summoned." It is not unlikely, however, that these large
expressions were inadvertently used, and that they led to that inundation
of voters without property which rendered the subsequent act of Henry VI.
necessary. That of Henry IV. had itself been occasioned by an opposite
evil, the close election of knights by a few persons in the name of the
county.
</p><p>
Yet the consequence of the statute of Henry IV. was not to let in too many
voters, or to render elections tumultuous, in the largest of English
counties, whatever it might be in others. Prynne has published some
singular sheriff's indentures for the county of York, all during the
interval between the acts of Henry IV. and Henry VI., which are sealed by
a few persons calling themselves the attorneys of some peers and ladies,
who, as far as appears, had solely returned the knights of that shire. 3
Prynne, p. 152. What degree of weight these anomalous returns ought to
possess I leave to the reader.</p></div>

corporations, which carry the legal, which is not always the moral,
presumption of an original charter. But "many boroughs and towns in
England have burgesses by prescription, that never were incorporated." Ch.
J. Hobart in Dungannon Case, Hobart's Reports, p. 15. And Mr. Luders
thinks, I know not how justly, that in the age of Edward I., which is most
to our immediate purpose, "there were not perhaps thirty corporations in
the kingdom." Reports of Elections, vol. i. p. 98. But I must allow that,
in the opinion of many sound lawyers, the representation of unchartered,
or at least, unincorporated boroughs was rather a <i>real</i> privilege, and
founded upon tenure, than one arising out of their share in public
contributions. Ch. J. Holt in Ashby v. White, 2 Ld. Raymond, 951. Heywood

more so, because the learning directed towards it has more frequently been
that of advocates pleading for their clients than of unbiassed

even argues that this power of omitting ancient boroughs was legally
vested in the sheriff before the 5th of Richard II.; and though the
language of that act implies the contrary of this position, yet it is more
than probable that most of our parliamentary boroughs by prescription,
especially such as were then unincorporated, are indebted for their
privileges to the exercise of the sheriff's discretion; not founded on
partiality, which would rather have led him to omit them, but on the broad
principle that they were sufficiently opulent and important to send

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_265_265" id="Footnote_265_265"></a><a href="#FNanchor_265_265"><span class="label">[a]</span></a> It is a perplexing question whether freeholders in socage
were liable to contribute towards the wages of knights; and authorities
might be produced on both sides. The more probable supposition is, that
they were not exempted. See the various petitions relating to the payment
of wages in Prynne's fourth Register. This is not unconnected with the
question as to their right of suffrage. See p. 115 of this volume.
Freeholders within franchises made repeated endeavours to exempt
themselves from payment of wages. Thus in 9 H. IV. it was settled by
parliament that, to put an end to the disputes on this subject between the
people of Cambridgeshire and those of the Isle of Ely, the latter should
pay 200<i>l.</i> and be quit in future of all charges on that account. Rot.
Parl. vol. iv. p. 383. By this means the inhabitants of that franchise
seem to have purchased the right of suffrage, which they still enjoy,
though not, I suppose, suitors to the county-court. In most other
franchises, and in many cities erected into distinct counties, the same
privilege of voting for knights of the shire is practically exercised; but
whether this has not proceeded as much from the tendency of returning
officers and of parliament to favour the right of election in doubtful
cases, as from the merits of their pretensions, may be a question.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_266_266" id="Footnote_266_266"></a><a href="#FNanchor_266_266"><span class="label">[b]</span></a> The wages of knights and burgesses were first reduced to
this certain sum by the writs De levandis expensis, 16 E. II. Prynne's
fourth Register, p. 53. These were issued at the request of those who had
served, after the dissolution of parliament, and included a certain number
of days, according to the distance of the county whence they came, for
going and returning. It appears by these that thirty-five or forty miles
were reckoned a day's journey; which may correct the exaggerated notions
of bad roads and tardy locomotion that are sometimes entertained. See
Prynne's fourth Register, and Willis's Notitia Parliamentaria, passim.
</p><p>
The latest entries of writs for expenses in the close rolls are of 2 H.
V.; but they may be proved to have issued much longer; and Prynne traces
them to the end of Henry VIII.'s reign, p. 495. Without the formality of
this writ a very few instances of towns remunerating their burgesses for
attendance in parliament are known to have occurred in later times. Andrew
Marvel is commonly said to have been the last who received this honourable
salary. A modern book asserts that wages were paid in some Cornish
boroughs as late as the eighteenth century. Lysons's Cornwall, preface, p.
xxxii; but the passage quoted in proof of this is not precise enough to
support so unlikely a fact.</p></div>

of equal learning was ever less inclined to depreciate popular rights,
inclines more than we should expect to the school of Brady in this point.
"There is reason to believe that originally the right of election in
boroughs was vested in the governing part of these communities, or in a
select portion of the burgesses; and that, in the progress of the house of
commons to power and importance, the tendency has been in general to
render the elections more popular. It is certain that for many years
burgesses were elected in the county courts, and apparently by delegates
from the boroughs, who were authorised by their fellow-burgesses to elect
representatives for them in parliament. In the reigns of James I. and
Charles I., when popular principles were in their greatest vigour, there
was a strong disposition in the house of commons to extend the right of
suffrage in boroughs, and in many instances these efforts were crowned
with success." Edin. Rev. xxviii. 145. But an election by delegates chosen
for that purpose by the burgesses at large is very different from one by
the governing part of the community. Even in the latter case, however,
this part had generally been chosen, at a greater or less interval of
time, by the entire body. Sometimes, indeed, corporations fell into
self-election and became close.</p></div>

and constitution of the house of lords during this period, I have been
much indebted to the first part of Prynne's Register, and to West's
Inquiry into the Manner of creating Peers; which, though written with a
party motive, to serve the ministry of 1719 in the peerage bill, deserves,
for the perspicuity of the method and style, to be reckoned among the best
of our constitutional dissertations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_292_292" id="Footnote_292_292"></a><a href="#FNanchor_292_292"><span class="label">[f]</span></a> Baronies were often divided by descent among females into
many parts, each retaining its character as a fractional member of a
barony. The tenants in such case were said to hold of the king by the
third, fourth, or twentieth part of a barony, and did service or paid
relief in such proportion.</p></div>

28, 33. That a baron could only be tried by his fellow barons was probably
a rule as old as the trial per pais of a commoner. In 4 E. III. Sir Simon
Bereford having been accused before the lords in parliament of aiding and
advising Mortimer in his treasons, they declared with one voice that he
was not their peer; wherefore they were not bound to judge him as a peer
of the land; but inasmuch as it was notorious that he had been concerned
in usurpation of royal powers and murder of the liege lord (as they styled
Edward II.), the lords, as judges of parliament, by assent of the king in
parliament, awarded and adjudged him to be hanged. A like sentence with a
like protestation was passed on Mautravers and Gournay. There is a very
remarkable anomaly in the case of Lord Berkley, who, though undoubtedly a
baron, his ancestors having been summoned from the earliest date of writs,
put himself on his trial in parliament, by twelve knights of the county of
Gloucester. Rot. Parl. vol. ii. p. 53; Rymer, t. iv. p. 734.</p></div>

summoned to parliament were in general considerably more numerous than the
temporal. Prynne, p. 114. This appears, among other causes, to have saved
the church from that sweeping reformation of its wealth, and perhaps of
its doctrines, which the commons were thoroughly inclined to make under
Richard II. and Henry IV. Thus the reduction of the spiritual lords by the
dissolution of monasteries was indispensably required to bring the
ecclesiastical order into due subjection to the state.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_297_297" id="Footnote_297_297"></a><a href="#FNanchor_297_297"><span class="label">[m]</span></a> Perhaps it can hardly be said that the king's prerogative
compelled the party summoned, not being a tenant by barony, to take his
seat. But though several spiritual persons appear to have been discharged
from attendance on account of their holding nothing by barony, as has been
justly observed, yet there is, I believe, no instance of any layman's
making such an application. The terms of the ancient writ of summons,
however, in fide et <i>homagio</i> quibus nobis tenemini, afford a presumption
that a feudal tenure was, in construction of law, the basis of every
lord's attendance in parliament. This form was not finally changed to the
present, in fide et <i>ligeanti√¢</i>, till the 46th of Edw. III. Prynne's first

by barony.</p></div>

case of the barony of L'Isle, that a writ of summons, with sufficient
proof of having sat by virtue of it in the house of lords, did in fact
create an hereditary peerage from the fifth year of Richard II., though he
resisted this with respect to claimants who could only deduce their
pedigree from an ancestor summoned by one of the three Edwards. Nicolas's
Case of Barony of L'Isle, p. 200. The theory, therefore, of West, which
denies peerage by writ even to those summoned in several later reigns,
must be taken with limitation. "I am informed," it is said by Mr. Hart,
<i>arguendo</i>, "that every person whose name appears in the writ of summons
of 5 Ric. II. was again summoned to the following parliament, and their
posterity have sat in parliament as peers." p. 233.</p></div>

speaks of bannerets as well as of dukes, earls, and barons, as persons
bound to attend the parliament; but it does not follow that banneret was
then considered as a name of dignity distinct from that honourable
knighthood under the king's banner in the field of battle, to which
precedence of all other knights was attributed." p. 342. But did the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_313_313" id="Footnote_313_313"></a><a href="#FNanchor_313_313"><span class="label">[e]</span></a> These descended from two persons, each named Geoffrey le
Scrope, chief justices of K.B. and C.B. at the beginning of Edward III.'s
reign. The name of one of them is once found among the barons, but I
presume this to have been an accident, or mistake in the roll; as he is
frequently mentioned afterwards among the judges. Scrope, chief justice of
K.B., was made a <i>banneret</i> in 14 E. III. He was the father of Henry
Scrope of Masham, a considerable person in Edward III. and Richard II.'s
government, whose grandson, Lord Scrope of Masham, was beheaded for a
conspiracy against Henry V. There was a family of Scrupe as old as the
reign of Henry II.; but it is not clear, notwithstanding Dugdale's
assertion, that the Scropes descended from them, or at least that they
held the same lands: nor were the Scrupes barons, as appears by their
paying a relief of only sixty marks for three knights' fees. Dugdale's
Baronage, p. 654.
</p><p>
The want of consistency in old records throws much additional difficulty
over this intricate subject. Thus Scrope of Masham, though certainly a
baron, and tried next year by the peers, is called chevalier in an
instrument of 1 H. V. Rymer, t. ix. p. 13. So in the indictment against
Sir John Oldcastle he is constantly styled knight, though he had been
summoned several times as lord Cobham, in right of his wife, who inherited
that barony. Rot. Parl. vol. iv. p. 107.</p></div>

progress of reformation, petitioned that, "according to the tenor of the
king's writ, and the ancient customs of the realm, they might have room
and place and be associated with the commons in the nether house of this
present parliament, as members of the commonwealth and the king's most
humble subjects." Burnet's Hist. of Reformation, vol. ii.; Appendix, No.

This assertion that the clergy had ever been associated as one body with
the commons is not borne out by anything that appears on our records, and
is contradicted by many passages. But it is said that the clergy were
actually so united with the commons in the Irish parliament till the
Reformation. Gilbert's Hist. of the Exchequer, p. 57.</p></div>

convocation. Since the Reformation the clause has been preserved for form

of 21 R. II., that the clergy of both provinces were not only present, but
that they were accounted an essential part of parliament in temporal
matters, which is contrary to the whole tenor of our laws. The commons are
there said to have prayed that, "whereas many judgments and ordinances
formerly made in parliament had been annulled <i>because the estate of
clergy had not been present thereat</i>, the prelates and clergy might make a
proxy with sufficient power to consent in their name to all things done in
this parliament." Whereupon the spiritual lords agreed to intrust their
powers to Sir Thomas Percy, and gave him a procuration commencing in the
following words: "Nos Thomas Cantuar' et Robertus Ebor' archiepiscopi, ac
pr√¶lati <i>et clerus utriusque provinci√¶ Cantuar' et Ebor' jure ecclesiarum
nostrarum et temporalium earundem habentes jus interessendi in singulis
parliamentis</i> domini nostri regis et regni Angli√¶ pro tempore celebrandis,
necnon tractandi et expediendi in eisdem quantum ad singula in instanti
parliamento pro statu et honore domini nostri regis, necnon regali√¶ su√¶,
ac quiete, pace, et tranquillitate regni judicialiter justificandis,
venerabili viro domino Thom√¶ de Percy militi, nostram plenarie committimus
potestatem." It may be perceived by these expressions, and more
unequivocally by the nature of the case, that it was the judicial power of
parliament which the spiritual lords delegated to their proxy. Many
impeachments for capital offences were coming on, at which, by their
canons, the bishops could not assist. But it can never be conceived that
the inferior clergy had any share in this high judicature. And, upon
looking attentively at the words above printed in italics, it will be
evident that the spiritual lords holding by barony are the only persons
designated; whatever may have been meant by the singular phrase, as
applied to them, clerus utriusque provinci√¶. Rot. Parl. vol. iii. p. 348.</p></div>

after the reign of Henry VI.; the former style was "ordinary" or
"continual council." But a distinction had always been made, according to
the nature of the business: the great officers of state, or, as we might
now say, the ministers, had no occasion for the presence of judges or any
lawyers in the secret councils of the crown. They become, therefore, a
council of government, though always members of the <i>consilium
ordinarium</i>; and, in the former capacity, began to keep formal records of
their proceedings. The acts of this council though, as I have just said,
it bore as yet no distinguishing name, are extant from the year 1386, and
for seventy years afterwards are known through the valuable publication of
Sir Harris Nicolas.</p></div>

the 25th of Edward III. is the most extensively beneficial act in the
whole body of our laws. It established certainty in treasons, regulated
purveyance, prohibited arbitrary imprisonment and the determination of
pleas of freehold before the council, took away the compulsory finding of
men-at-arms and other troops, confirmed the reasonable aid of the king's
tenants fixed by 3 E. I., and provided that the king's protection should
not hinder civil process or execution.</p></div>

surprising that the king's council should have persisted in these
transgressions of their lawful authority, when we find a similar
jurisdiction usurped by the officers of inferior persons. Complaint is
made in the 18th of Richard II. that men were compelled to answer before
<i>the council of divers lords and ladies</i>, for their freeholds and other
matters cognizable at common law, and a remedy for this abuse is given by
petition in chancery, stat. 15 R. II. c. 12. This act is confirmed with a
penalty on its contraveners the next year, 16 R. II. c. 2. The private
gaols which some lords were permitted by law to possess, and for which
there was always a provision in their castles, enabled them to render this
oppressive jurisdiction effectual.</p></div>

put to answer for his freehold in parliament, nor before any court or
council where such things are not cognizable by the law of the land," the
king gave a denial. As it was less usual to refuse promises of this kind
than to forget them afterwards, I do not understand the motive of this.</p></div>

p. 553. The last author places this a little later. There is a petition of
the commons, in the roll of the 4th of Henry IV. p. 511, that, whereas
many grantees and feoffees in trust for their grantors and feoffers
alienate or charge the tenements granted, <i>in which case there is no
remedy unless one is ordered by parliament</i>, that the king and lords would
provide a remedy. This petition is referred to the king's council to
advise of a remedy against the ensuing parliament. It may perhaps be
inferred from hence that the writ of subp&oelig;na out of chancery had not
yet been applied to protect the cestui que use. But it is equally possible
that the commons, being disinclined to what they would deem an illegal
innovation, were endeavouring to reduce these fiduciary estates within the
pale of the common law, as was afterwards done by the statute of uses.

in parliament 8 H. VI. for the regulation of the council. "Item, that alle
the billes that comprehend matters terminable atte the common lawe shall
be remitted ther to be determined; but if so be that the discresion of the
counseill fele to grete myght on that √µ syde, and unmyght on that other,
or elles other cause resonable yat shal move him." Rot. Parl. vol. iv. p.
343. Mr. Bruce has well observed of the articles agreed upon in 8 Hen.
VI., or rather of "those in 5 Hen. VI., which were nearly the same, that
in theory nothing could be more excellent. In turbulent times, it is
scarcely necessary to remark, great men were too apt to weigh out justice
for themselves, and with no great nicety; a court, therefore, to which the
people might fly for relief against powerful oppressors, was most
especially needful. Law charges also were considerable; and this, 'the
poor man's court, in which he might have right without paying any money'
(Sir T. Smith's Commonwealth, book iii. ch. 7), was an institution
apparently calculated to be of unquestionable utility. It was the
comprehensiveness of the last clause&mdash;the 'other cause resonable'&mdash;which
was its ruin." Arch√¶ologia, vol. xxv. p. 348. The statute 31 Hen. VI. c.
2, which is not printed in Ruffhead's edition, is very important, as
giving a legal authority to the council, by writs under the great seal,
and by writs of proclamation to the sheriffs, on parties making default,
to compel the attendance of any persons complained of for "great riots,
extortions, oppressions, and grievous offences," under heavy penalties; in
case of a peer, "the loss of his estate, and name of lord, and his place
in parliament," and all his lands for the term of his life; and fine at
discretion in the case of other persons. A proviso is added that no matter
determinable by the law of the realm should be determined in other form
than after the course of law in the king's courts. Sir Francis Palgrave
(Essay on the King's Council, p. 84) observes that this proviso "would in
no way interfere with the effective jurisdiction of the council, inasmuch
as it could always be alleged in the bills which were preferred before it
that the oppressive and grievous offences of which they complained were
not determinable by the ordinary course of the common law" p. 86. But this
takes the word "determinable" to mean <i>in fact</i>; whereas I apprehend that
the proviso must be understood to mean cases legally determinable; the
words, I think, will bear no other construction. But as all the offences
enumerated were indictable, we must either hold the proviso to be utterly
inconsistent with the rest of the statute, or suppose that the words
"other form" were intended to prohibit the irregular process usual with
the council; secret examination of witnesses, torture, neglect of
technical formality in specifying charges, punishments not according to
the course of law, and other violations of fair and free trial, which
constituted the greatest grievance in the proceedings of the council.</p></div>

Edward III., impelled by the exigencies of his French war, went still
greater lengths, and seized larger quantities of wool, which he sold
beyond sea, as well as provisions for the supply of his army. In both
cases the proprietors had tallies, or other securities; but their despair
of obtaining payment gave rise, in 1338, to an insurrection. There is a

of justice led to an excellent act in 2 E. III. c. 8, that the judges
shall not omit to do right for any command under the great or privy seal.
And the conduct of Richard II., who sought absolute power by corrupting or
intimidating them, produced another statute in the eleventh year of his
reign (c. 10), providing that neither letters of the king's signet nor of
the privy seal should from thenceforth be sent in disturbance of the law.
An ordinance of Charles V., king of France, in 1369, directs the
parliament of Paris to pay no regard to any letters under his seal
suspending the course of legal procedure, but to consider them as
surreptitiously obtained. Villaret, t. x. p. 175. This ordinance, which
was sedulously observed, tended very much to confirm the independence and
integrity of that tribunal.</p></div>

p. 1. Hume quotes a grant of the office of constable to the earl of Rivers
in 7 E. IV., and infers, unwarrantably enough, that "its authority was in
direct contradiction to Magna Charta; and it is evident that no regular
liberty could subsist with it. It involved a full dictatorial power,
continually subsisting in the state." Hist. of England, c. 22. But by the
very words of this patent the jurisdiction given was only over such causes
qu√¶ in curi√¢ constabularii Angli√¶ ab antiquo, viz. tempore dicti Gulielmi
conqu√¶storis, seu aliquo tempore citra, tractari, audiri, examinari, aut
decidi consueverunt aut <i>jure debuerant aut debent</i>. These are expressed,
though not very perspicuously, in the statute 13 R. II. c. 2, that
declares the constable's jurisdiction. And the chief criminal matter
reserved by law to the court of this officer was treason committed out of
the kingdom. In violent and revolutionary seasons, such as the
commencement of Edward IV.'s reign, some persons were tried by martial law
before the constable. But, in general, the exercise of criminal justice by
this tribunal, though one of the abuses of the times, cannot be said to
warrant the strong language adopted by Hume.</p></div>

might perhaps be called rude in some respects. But assuredly in prudent
and circumspect perception of consequences, and an accurate use of

propounded to several monasteries and divines. Most of these relate to the
main subject. But one question, fitter indeed for lawyers than
theologians, was, whereas many would not confess without torture, whether
he might make use of this means, <i>licet hoc in regno Angli√¶ nunquam visum

disseisor and reinstate himself without course of law. In what case this
right of entry was taken away, or <i>tolled</i>, as it was expressed, by the
death or alienation of the disseisor, is a subject extensive enough to
occupy two chapters of Littleton. What pertains to our inquiry is, that by
an entry in the old law-books we must understand an actual repossession of
the disseisee, not a suit in ejectment, as it is now interpreted, but
which is a comparatively modern proceeding. The first remedy, says
Britton, of the disseisee is to collect a body of his friends (recoiller
amys et force), and without delay to cast out the disseisors, or at least
to maintain himself in possession along with them. c. 44. This entry ought
indeed, by 5 R. II. stat. i. c. 8, to be made peaceably; and the justices
might assemble the posse comitatus to imprison persons entering on lands
by violence (15 R. II. c. 2), but these laws imply the facts that made
them necessary.</p></div>

appears that, far from these acts being regarded, it was considered as a
mark of respect to the king, when he came into a county, for the noblemen
and gentry to meet him with as many attendants in livery as they could
muster. Sir John Paston was to provide twenty men in their livery-gowns,
and the duke of Norfolk two hundred. This illustrates the well-known story
of Henry VII. and the earl of Oxford, and shows the mean and oppressive
conduct of the king in that affair, which Hume has pretended to justify.
</p><p>
In the first of Edward IV. it is said in the roll of parliament (vol. v.
p. 407), that, "by yeving of liveries and signets, contrary to the
statutes and ordinances made aforetyme maintenaunce of quarrels,
extortions, robberies, murders been multiplied and continued within this
reame, to the grete disturbaunce and inquietation of the same."</p></div>

quidam maligni, fulti quorundam magnatum pr√¶sidio, regis adolescentiam
spernentes, et regnum perturbare intendentes, in tantam turbam creverunt,
nemora et saltus occupaverunt, ita quod toti regno terrori essent.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_389_389" id="Footnote_389_389"></a><a href="#FNanchor_389_389"><span class="label">[q]</span></a> I am aware that in many, probably a great majority of
reported cases, this word was technically used, where some unwarranted
conveyance, such as a feoffment by the tenant for life, was held to have
wrought a disseisin; or where the plaintiff was allowed, for the purpose
of a more convenient remedy, to feign himself disseised, which was called
disseisin by election. But several proofs might be brought from the
parliamentary petitions, and I doubt not, if nearly looked at, from the
Year-books, that in other cases there was an actual and violent expulsion.
And the definition of disseisin in all the old writers, such as Britton
and Littleton, is obviously framed upon its primary meaning of violent
dispossession, which the word had probably acquired long before the more
peaceable disseisins, if I may use the expression, became the subject of
the remedy by assise.
</p><p>
I would speak with deference of Lord Mansfield's elaborate judgment in
Taylor dem. Atkins v. Horde, 1 Burrow, 107, &amp;c.; but some positions in it
appear to me rather too strongly stated; and particularly that the
acceptance of the disseisor as tenant by the lord was necessary to render
the disseisin complete; a condition which I have not found hinted in any
law-book. See Butler's note on Co. Litt. p. 330; where that eminent lawyer
expresses similar doubts as to Lord Mansfield's reasoning. It may however
be remarked, that constructive or elective disseisins, being of a
technical nature, were more likely to produce cases in the Year-books than
those accompanied with actual violence, which would commonly turn only on
matters of fact, and be determined by a jury.
</p><p>
A remarkable instance of violent disseisin, amounting in effect to a
private war, may be found in the Paston Letters occupying most of the
fourth volume. One of the Paston family, claiming a right to Caistor
Castle, kept possession against the duke of Norfolk, who brought a large
force, and laid a regular siege to the place, till it surrendered for want
of provisions. Two of the besiegers were killed. It does not appear that
any legal measures were taken to prevent or punish this outrage.</p></div>

may be noticed among the violent courses of prerogative. By statute 2 E.
III. c. 2, confirmed by 10 E. III. c. 2, the king's power of granting
pardons was taken away, except in cases of homicide per infortunium.
Another act, 14 E. III. c. 15, reciting that the former laws in this
respect have not been kept, declares that all pardons contrary to them
shall be holden as null. This however was disregarded like the rest; and
the commons began tacitly to recede from them, and endeavoured to
compromise the question with the crown. By 27 E. III. stat. I, c. 2,
without adverting to the existing provisions, which may therefore seem to
be repealed by implication, it is enacted that in every charter of pardon,
granted at any one's suggestion, the suggestor's name and the grounds of
his suggestion shall be expressed, that if the same be found untrue it may
be disallowed. And in 13 R. II. stat. 2, c. 1, we are surprised to find
the commons requesting that pardons might not be granted, as if the
subject were wholly, unknown to the law; the king protesting in reply that
he will save his liberty and regality, as his progenitors had done before,
but conceding some regulations, far less remedial than what were provided
already by the 27th of Edward II. Pardons make a pretty large head in
Brooke's Abridgment, and were undoubtedly granted without scruple by every
one of our kings. A pardon obtained in a case of peculiar atrocity is the
subject of a specific remonstrance in 23 H. VI. Rot. Parl. vol. v. p.
111.</p></div>

rational cause can be alleged, kept Wales and even Cheshire distinct from
the rest of the kingdom. Nothing could be more injurious to the adjacent
counties. Upon the credit of their immunity from the jurisdiction of the
king's courts, the people of Cheshire broke with armed bands into the
neighbouring counties, and perpetrated all the crimes in their power. Rot.
Parl. vol. iii. p. 81, 201, 440; Stat. 1 H. IV. c. 18. As to the Welsh
frontier, it was constantly almost in a state of war, which a very little
good sense and benevolence in any one of our shepherds would have easily
prevented, by admitting the conquered people to partake in equal
privileges with their fellow-subjects. Instead of this, they satisfied
themselves with aggravating the mischief by granting legal reprisals upon
Welshmen. Stat. 2 H. IV. c. 16. Welshmen were absolutely excluded from
bearing offices in Wales. The English living in the English towns of Wales
earnestly petition, 23 H. VI. Rot. Parl. vol. v. p. 104, 154, that this
exclusion may be kept in force. Complaints of the disorderly state of the
Welsh frontier are repeated as late as 12 E. IV. vol. vi. p. 8.

It is curious that, so early as 15 E. II., a writ was addressed to the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_398_398" id="Footnote_398_398"></a><a href="#FNanchor_398_398"><span class="label">[b]</span></a> According to Bracton, the bastard of a nief, or female
villein, was born in servitude; and where the parents lived on a villein
tenement, the children of a nief, even though married to a freeman, were
villeins, 1. iv. c. 21; and see Beames's translation of Glanvil, p. 109.
But Littleton lays down an opposite doctrine, that a bastard was
necessarily free; because, being the child of no father in the
contemplation of law, he could not be presumed to inherit servitude from
any one; and makes no distinction as to the parent's residence. Sect 188.
I merely take notice of this change in the law between the reigns of Henry
III. and Edward IV. as an instance of the bias which the judges showed in
favour of personal freedom. Another, if we can rely upon it, is more
important. In the reign of Henry II. a freeman marrying a nief, and
settling on a villein tenement, lost the privileges of freedom during the
time of his occupation; legem terr√¶ quasi nativus amittit. Glanvil, 1. v.
c. 6. This was consonant to the customs of some other countries, some of
which went further, and treated such a person for ever as a villein. But,
on the contrary, we find in Britton, a century later, that the nief
herself by such a marriage became free during the coverture, c. 31. [<a href="#N13"><span class="smcap">Note</span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_399_399" id="Footnote_399_399"></a><a href="#FNanchor_399_399"><span class="label">[c]</span></a> I must confess that I have some doubts how far this was law
at the epoch of Magna Charta. Glanvil and Bracton both speak of the
<i>status villenagii</i>, as opposed to that of liberty, and seem to consider
it as a civil condition, not a merely personal relation. The civil law and
the French treatise of Beaumanoir hold the same language. And Sir Robert
Cotton maintains without hesitation that villeins are not within the 29th
section of Magna Charta, "being excluded by the word liber." Cotton's
Posthuma, p. 223. Britton, however, a little after Bracton, says that in
an action the villein is answerable to all men, and all men to him. p. 79.
And later judges, in favorem libertatis, gave this construction to the
villein's situation, which must therefore be considered as the clear law
of England in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.</p></div>

two former cases; but an indictment is √† fortiori; and he says, sect. 194,

maiming his villein.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_401_401" id="Footnote_401_401"></a><a href="#FNanchor_401_401"><span class="label">[e]</span></a> Gurdon, on Courts Baron, p. 592, supposes the villein in
gross to have been the Lazzus or Servus of early times, a domestic serf,
and of an inferior species to the cultivator, or villein regardant.
Unluckily Bracton and Littleton do not confirm this notion, which would be
convenient enough; for in Domesday Book there is a marked distinction
between the Servi and Villani. Blackstone expresses himself inaccurately
when he says the villein in gross was annexed to the person of the lord,
and transferable by deed from one owner to another. By this means indeed a
villein regardant would become a villein in gross, but all villeins were
alike liable to be sold by their owners. Littleton, sect. 181.
Blomefield's Norfolk, vol. iii. p. 860. Mr. Hargrave supposes that
villeins in gross were never numerous (Case of Somerset, Howell's State
Trials, vol. xx. p. 42): drawing this inference from the few cases
relative to them that occur in the Year-books. And certainly the form of a
writ de nativitate proband√¢, and the peculiar evidence it required, which
may be found in Fitzherbert's Natura Brevium, or in Mr. H.'s argument, are
only applicable to the other species. It is a doubtful point whether a
freeman could, in contemplation of law, become a villein in gross; though
his confession in a court of record, upon a suit already commenced (for
this was requisite), would estop him from claiming his liberty; and hence
Bracton speaks of this proceeding as a mode by which a freeman might fall
into servitude.</p></div>

little better than a tenant in mere villenage, except in name. But though,
from the relation between the lord and copyholder the latter might not be
permitted to sue his superior, yet it does not follow that he might not
bring his action against any person acting under the lord's direction, in
which the defendant could not set up an illegal authority; just as,
although no writ runs against the king, his ministers or officers are not
justified in acting under his command contrary to law. I wish this note to
be considered as correcting one in my first volume, p. 200, where I have
said that a similar law in France rendered the distinction between a serf
and a homme de poote little more than theoretical.</p></div>

and important. It ought to be read in preference to any of our historians.
Hume, who drew from inferior sources, is not altogether accurate. Yet one
remarkable circumstance, told by Hall and other chroniclers, that the duke
of York stood by the throne, as if to claim it, though omitted entirely in
the roll, is confirmed by Whethamstede, abbot of St. Albans, who was
probably then present. (p. 484, edit. Hearne.) This shows that we should

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_455_455" id="Footnote_455_455"></a><a href="#FNanchor_455_455"><span class="label">[q]</span></a> The rolls of Henry VII.'s first parliament are full of an
absurd confusion in thought and language, which is rendered odious by the
purposes to which it is applied. Both Henry VI. and Edward IV. are
considered as lawful kings; except in one instance, where Alan Cotterell,
petitioning for the reversal of his attainder, speaks of Edward, "late
called Edward IV." (vol. iv. p. 290.) But this is only the language of a
private Lancastrian. And Henry VI. passes for having been king during his
short restoration in 1470, when Edward had been nine years upon the
throne. For the earl of Oxford is said to have been attainted "for the
true allegiance and service he owed and did to Henry VI. at Barnet field
and otherwise." (p. 281.) This might be reasonable enough on the true
principle that allegiance is due to a king <i>de facto</i>; if indeed we could
determine who was the king de facto on the morning of the battle of
Barnet. But this principle was not fairly recognised. Richard III. is
always called, "in deed and not in right king of England." Nor was this
merely founded on his usurpation as against his nephew. For that
unfortunate boy is little better treated, and in the act of resumption, 1
H. VII., while Edward IV. is styled "late king," appears only with the
denomination of "Edward his son, late called Edward V." (p. 336.) Who then
was king after the death of Edward IV.? And was his son really
illegitimate, as an usurping uncle pretended? Or did the crime of Richard,
though punished in him, enure to the benefit of Henry? These were points
which, like the fate of the young princes in the Tower, he chose to wrap
in discreet silence. But the first question he seems to have answered in
his own favour. For Richard himself, Howard duke of Norfolk, Lord Lovel,
and some others, are attainted (p. 276) for "traiterously intending,
compassing, and imagining" the death of Henry; of course before or at the
battle of Bosworth; and while his right, unsupported by possession, could
have rested only on an hereditary title which it was an insult to the
nation to prefer. These monstrous proceedings explain the necessity of
that conservative statute to which I have already alluded, which passed in
the eleventh year of his reign, and afforded as much security for men
following the plain line of rallying round the standard of their country
as mere law can offer. There is some extraordinary reasoning upon this act
in Carte's History (vol. ii. p. 844), for the purpose of proving that the
adherents of George II. would not be protected by it on the restoration of
the true blood.</p></div>

Walpole, Carte, Henry, and Laing, who maintain that the duke of York, at
least, was in some way released from the Tower, and reappeared as Perkin
Warbeck. But a very strong conviction either way is not readily
attainable.</p></div>

<h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Part</span> III.)

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="N1" id="N1"></a>Note</span> I. Page 5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is rather a curious speculative question, and such only, we may
presume, it will long continue, whether bishops are entitled, on charges
of treason or felony, to a trial by the peers. If this question be
considered either theoretically or according to ancient authority, I think
the affirmative proposition is beyond dispute. Bishops were at all times
members of the great national council, and fully equal to lay lords in
temporal power as well as dignity. Since the Conquest they have held their
temporalities of the crown by a baronial tenure, which, if there be any
consistency in law, must unequivocally distinguish them from
commoners&mdash;since any one holding by barony might be challenged on a jury,
as not being the peer of the party whom he was to try. It is true that
they take no share in the judicial power of the house of lords in cases of
treason or felony; but this is merely in conformity to those
ecclesiastical canons which prohibited the clergy from partaking in
capital judgment, and they have always withdrawn from the house on such
occasions under a protestation of their right to remain. Had it not been
for this particularity, arising wholly out of their own discipline, the
question of their peerage could never have come into dispute. As for the
common argument that they are not tried as peers because they have no
inheritable nobility, I consider it as very frivolous, since it takes for
granted the precise matter in controversy, that an inheritable nobility is
necessary to the definition of peerage, or to its incidental privileges.</p>

<p>If we come to constitutional precedents, by which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> when sufficiently
numerous and unexceptionable, all questions of this kind are ultimately to
be determined, the weight of ancient authority seems to be in favour of
the prelates. In the fifteenth year of Edward III. (1340), the king
brought several charges against archbishop Stratford. He came to
parliament with a declared intention of defending himself before his
peers. The king insisted upon his answering in the court of exchequer.
Stratford however persevered, and the house of lords, by the king's
consent, appointed twelve of their number, bishops, earls, and barons, to
report whether peers ought to answer criminal charges in parliament, and
not elsewhere. This committee reported to the king in full parliament that
the peers of the land ought not to be arraigned, nor put on trial, except
in parliament and by their peers. The archbishop upon this prayed the
king, that, inasmuch as he had been notoriously defamed, he might be
arraigned in full parliament before the peers, and there make answer;
which request the king granted. (Rot. Parl. vol. ii. p. 127. Collier's
Eccles. Hist. vol. i. p. 543.) The proceedings against Stratford went no
further; but I think it impossible not to admit that his right to trial as
a peer was fully recognised both by the king and lords.</p>

<p>This is, however, the latest, and perhaps the only instance of a prelate's
obtaining so high a privilege. In the preceding reign of Edward II., if we
can rely on the account of Walsingham (p. 119), Adam Orleton, the factious
bishop of Hereford, had first been arraigned before the house of lords,
and subsequently convicted by a common jury; but the transaction was of a
singular nature, and the king might probably be influenced by the
difficulty of obtaining a conviction from the temporal peers, of whom many
were disaffected to him, in a case where privilege of clergy was
vehemently claimed. But about 1357 a bishop of Ely, being accused of
harbouring one guilty of murder, though he demanded a trial by the peers,
was compelled to abide the verdict of a jury. (Collier, p. 557.) In the
31st of Edw. III. (1358) the abbot of Missenden was hanged for coining. (2
Inst. p. 635.) The abbot of this monastery appears from Dugdale to have
been summoned by writ in the 49th of Henry III. If he actually held by
barony, I do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
not perceive any strong distinction between his case and
that of a bishop. The leading precedent, however, and that upon which
lawyers principally found their denial of this privilege to the bishops,
is the case of Fisher, who was certainly tried before an ordinary jury;
nor am I aware that any remonstrance was made by himself, or complaint by
his friends, upon this ground. Cranmer was treated in the same manner; and
from these two, being the most recent precedents, though neither of them
in the best of times, the great plurality of law-books have drawn a
conclusion that bishops are not entitled to trial by the temporal peers.
Nor can there be much doubt that, whenever the occasion shall occur, this
will be the decision of the house of lords.</p>

<p>There are two peculiarities, as it may naturally appear, in the
above-mentioned resolution of the lords in Stratford's case. The first is,
that they claim to be tried, not only before their peers, but in
parliament. And in the case of the bishop of Ely it is said to have been
objected to his claim of trial by his peers, that parliament was not then
sitting. (Collier, ubi sup.) It is most probable, therefore, that the
court of the lord high steward, for the special purpose of trying a peer,
was of more recent institution&mdash;as appears also from Sir E. Coke's
expressions. (4 Inst. p. 58.) The second circumstance that may strike a
reader is, that the lords assert their privilege in all criminal cases,
not distinguishing misdemeanors from treasons and felonies. But in this
they were undoubtedly warranted by the clear language of Magna Charta,
which makes no distinction of the kind. The practice of trying a peer for
misdemeanors by a jury of commoners, concerning the origin of which I can
say nothing, is one of those anomalies which too often render our laws
capricious and unreasonable in the eyes of impartial men.</p>

<p>Since writing the above note I have read Stillingfleet's treatise on the
judicial power of the bishops in capital cases&mdash;a right which, though now,
I think, abrogated by non-claim and a course of contrary precedents, he
proves beyond dispute to have existed by the common law and constitutions
of Clarendon, to have been occasionally exercised, and to have been only
suspended by their voluntary act. In the course of this argument he treats
of the peerage of the bishops, and produces abundant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> evidence from the
records of parliament that they were styled peers, for which, though
convinced from general recollection, I had not leisure or disposition to
search. But if any doubt should remain, the statute 25 E. III. c. 6,
contains a legislative declaration of the peerage of bishops. The whole
subject is discussed with much perspicuity and force by Stillingfleet, who
seems however not to press very greatly the right of trial by peers, aware
no doubt of the weight of opposite precedents. (Stillingfleet's Works,
vol. iii. p. 820.) In one distinction, that the bishops vote in their
judicial functions as barons, but in legislation as magnates, which
Warburton has brought forward as his own in the Alliance of Church and
State, Stillingfleet has perhaps not taken the strongest ground, nor
sufficiently accounted for their right of sitting in judgment on the
impeachment of a commoner. Parliamentary impeachment, upon charges of high
public crimes, seems to be the exercise of a right inherent in the great
council of the nation, some traces of which appear even before the
Conquest (Chron. Sax. p. 164, 169), independent of and superseding that of
trial by peers, which, if the 29th section of Magna Charta be strictly
construed, is only required upon indictments at the king's suit. And this
consideration is of great weight in the question, still unsettled, whether
a commoner can be tried by the lords upon an impeachment for treason.</p>

<p>The treatise of Stillingfleet was written on occasion of the objection
raised by the commons to the bishops voting on the question of Lord
Danby's pardon, which he pleaded in bar of his impeachment. Burnet seems
to suppose that their right to final judgment had never been defended, and
confounds judgment with sentence. Mr. Hargrave, strange to say, has made a
much greater blunder, and imagined that the question related to their
right of voting on a bill of attainder, which no one, I believe, ever
disputed. (Notes on Co. Litt. 134 b.)</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N2" id="N2"></a>Note</span> II. Page 9.</p>

<p>The constitution of parliament in this period, antecedent to the Great
Charter, has been minutely and scrupulously investigated by the Lords'
Committee on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the Dignity of a Peer in 1819. Two questions may be raised
as to the lay portion of the great council of the nation from the Conquest
to the reign of John:&mdash;first, Did it comprise any members, whether from
the counties or boroughs, not holding themselves, nor deputed by others
holding in chief of the crown by knight-service or grand serjeanty?
secondly, Were all such tenants <i>in capite</i> personally, or in
contemplation of law, assisting, by advice and suffrage, in councils held
for the purpose of laying on burthens, or for permanent and important
legislation?</p>

<p>The former of these questions they readily determine. The committee have
discovered no proof, nor any likelihood from analogy, that the great
council, in these Norman reigns, was composed of any who did not hold in
chief of the crown by a military tenure, or one in grand serjeanty; and
they exclude, not only tenants in petty serjeanty and socage, but such as
held of an escheated barony, or, as it was called, <i>de honore</i>.</p>

<p>They found more difficulty in the second question. It has generally been
concluded, and I may have taken it for granted in my text, that all
military tenants <i>in capite</i> were summoned, or ought to have been
summoned, to any great council of the realm, whether for the purpose of
levying a new tax, or any other affecting the public weal. The committee,
however, laudably cautious in drawing any positive inference, have moved
step by step through this obscure path with a circumspection as honourable
to themselves as it renders their ultimate judgment worthy of respect.</p>

<p>"The council of the kingdom, however composed (they are adverting to the
reign of Henry I.), must have been assembled by the king's command; and
the king, therefore, may have assumed the power of selecting the persons
to whom he addressed the command, especially if the object of assembling
such a council was not to impose any burthen on any of the subjects of the
realm exempted from such burthens except by their own free grants. Whether
the king was at this time considered as bound by any constitutional law to
address such command to any particular persons, designated by law as
essential parts of such an assembly for all purposes, the committee have
been unable to ascertain. It has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
generally been considered as the law of
the land that the king had a right to require the advice of any of his
subjects, and their personal services, for the general benefit of the
kingdom; but as, by the terms of the charters of Henry and of his father,
no aid could be required of the immediate tenants of the crown by military
service, beyond the obligation of their respective tenures, if the crown
had occasion for any extraordinary aid from those tenants, it must have
been necessary, according to law, to assemble all persons so holding, to
give their consent to the imposition. Though the numbers of such tenants
of the crown were not originally very great, as far as appears from
Domesday, yet, if it was necessary to convene all to form a constitutional
legislative assembly, the distances of their respective residences, and
the inconvenience of assembling at one time, in one spot, all those who
thus held of the crown, and upon whom the maintenance of the Conquest
itself must for a considerable time have importantly depended, must have
produced difficulties, even in the reign of the Conqueror; and the
increase of their numbers by subdivision of tenures must have greatly
increased the difficulty in the reign of his son Henry: and at length, in
the reigns of his successors, it must have been almost impossible to have
convened such an assembly, except by general summons of the greater part
of the persons who were to form it; and unless those who obeyed the
summons could bind those who did not, the powers of the assembly when
convened must have been very defective." (p. 40.)</p>

<p>Though I do not perceive why we should assume any great subdivision of
tenures before the statute of <i>Quia Emptores</i>, in 18 Edw. I., which
prohibited subinfeudation, it is obvious that the committee have pointed
out the inconvenience of a scheme which gave all tenants <i>in capite</i> (more
numerous in Domesday than they perhaps were aware) a right to assist at
great councils. Still, as it is manifest from the early charters, and
explicitly admitted by the committee, that the king could raise no
extraordinary contribution from his immediate vassals by his own
authority, and as there was no feudal subordination between one of these
and another, however differing in wealth, it is clear that they were legally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
entitled to a voice, be it through general or special summons, in
the imposition of taxes which they were to pay. It will not follow that
they were summoned, or had an acknowledged right to be summoned, on the
few other occasions when legislative measures were in contemplation, or in
the determinations taken by the king's great council. This can only be
inferred by presumptive proof or constitutional analogy.</p>

<p>The eleventh article of the Constitutions of Clarendon in 1164 declares
that archbishops, bishops, and all persons of the realm who hold of the
king <i>in capite</i>, possess their lands as a barony, and are bound to attend
in the judgments of the king's court like other barons. It is plain, from
the general tenor of these constitutions, that "univers√¶ person√¶ regni"
must be restrained to ecclesiastics; and the only words which can be
important in the present discussion are "sicut barones c√¶teri." "It
seems," says the committee, "to follow that all those termed the king's
barons were tenants in chief of the king; but it does not follow that all
tenants in chief of the king were the king's barons, and as such bound to
attend his court. They might not be bound to attend unless they held their
lands of the king in chief 'sicut baroniam,' as expressed in this article
with respect to the archbishops and other clergy." (p. 44.) They conclude,
however, that "upon the whole the Constitutions of Clarendon, if the
existing copies be correct, afford strong ground for presuming that owing
suit to the king's great court rendered the tenant one of the king's
barons or members of that court, though probably in general none attended
who were not specially summoned. It has been already observed that this
would not include all the king's tenants in chief, and particularly those
who did not hold of him as of his crown, or even to all who did hold of
him as of his crown, but not by knight-service or grand serjeanty, which
were alone deemed military and honourable tenures; though, whether all who
held of the king as of his crown, by knight-service or grand serjeanty,
did originally owe suit to the king's court, or whether that obligation
was confined to persons holding by a particular tenure, called <i>tenure per
baroniam</i>, as has been asserted, the Constitutions of Clarendon do not
assist to ascertain." (p. 45.) But this, as they point out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> involves the
question whether the <i>Curia Regis</i>, mentioned in these constitutions, was
not only a judicial but a legislative assembly, or one competent to levy a
tax on military tenants, since by the terms of the charter of Henry I.,
confirmed by that of Henry II., all such tenants were clearly exempted
from taxation, except by their own consents.</p>

<p>They touch slightly on the reign of Richard I. with the remark that "the
result of all which they have found with respect to the constitution of
the legislative assemblies of the realm still leaves the subject in great
obscurity." (p. 49.) But it is remarkable that they have never alluded to
the presence of tenants in chief, knights as well as barons, at the
parliament of Northampton under Henry II. They come, however, rather
suddenly to the conclusion that "the records of the reign of John seem to
give strong ground for supposing that all the king's tenants in chief by
military tenure, if not all the tenants in
chief,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
were at one time deemed necessary members of the common councils of the realm, when
summoned for extraordinary purposes, and especially for the purpose of
obtaining a grant of any extraordinary aid to the king; and this opinion
accords with what has generally been deemed originally the law in France,
of other countries where what is called the feudal system of tenures has
been established." (p. 54.) It cannot surely admit of a doubt, and has
been already affirmed more than once by the committee, that for an
extraordinary grant of money the consent of military tenants in chief was
required long before the reign of John. Nor was that a reign, till the
enactment of the Great Charter, when any fresh extension of political
liberty was likely to have become established. But the difficulty may
still remain with respect to "extraordinary purposes" of another
description.</p>

<p>They observe afterwards that "they have found no document before the Great
Charter of John in which the term 'majores barones' has been used, though in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
subsequent documents words of apparently similar import have been
used. From the instrument itself it might be presumed that the term
'majores barones' was then a term in some degree understood; and that the
distinction had, therefore, an earlier origin, though the committee have
not found the term in any earlier instrument." (p. 67.) But though the
Dialogue on the Exchequer, generally referred to the reign of Henry II.,
is not an instrument, it is a law-book of sufficient reputation, and in
this we read&mdash;"Quidam de rege tenent in capite qu√¶ ad coronam pertinent;
baronias scilicet majores seu minores." (Lib. ii. cap. 10.) It would be
trifling to dispute that the tenant of a <i>baronia major</i> might be called a
<i>baro major</i>. And what could the <i>secund√¶ dignitatis barones</i> at
Northampton have been but tenants <i>in capite</i> holding fiefs by some line
or other distinguishable from a superior
class?<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>It appears, therefore, on the whole, that in the judgment of the
committee, by no means indulgent in their requisition of evidence, or
disposed to take the more popular side, all the military tenants <i>in
capite</i> were constitutionally members of the <i>commune concilium</i> of the
realm during the Norman constitution. This <i>commune concilium</i> the
committee distinguish from a <i>magnum concilium</i>, though it seems doubtful
whether there were any very definite line between the two. But that the
consent of these tenants was required for taxation they repeatedly
acknowledge. And there appears sufficient evidence that they were
occasionally present for other important purposes. It is, however, very
probable that writs of summons were actually addressed only to those of
distinguished name, to those resident near the place of meeting, or to the
servants and favourites of the crown. This seems to be deducible from the
words in the Great Charter, which limit the king's engagement to summon
all tenants in chief, through the sheriff, to the case of his requiring an
aid or scutage, and still more from the withdrawing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> this promise in
the first year of Henry III. The privilege of attending on such occasions,
though legally general, may never have been generally exercised.</p>

<p>The committee seem to have been perplexed about the word <i>magnates</i>
employed in several records to express part of those present in great
councils. In general they interpret it, as well as the word <i>proceres</i>, to
include persons not distinguished by the name "<i>barones</i>;" a word which in
the reign of Henry III. seems to have been chiefly used in the restricted
sense it has latterly acquired. Yet in one instance, a letter addressed to
the justiciar of Ireland, 1 Hen. III., they suppose the word <i>magnates</i> to
"exclude those termed therein 'alii quamplurimi;' and consequently to be
confined to prelates, earls, and barons. This may be deemed important in
the consideration of many other instruments in which the word <i>magnates</i>
has been used to express persons constituting the 'commune concilium
regni.'" But this strikes me as an erroneous construction of the letter.
The words are as follows:&mdash;"Convenerunt apud Glocestriam plures regni
nostri magnates, episcopi, abbates, comites, et barones, qui patri nostro
viventi semper astiterunt fideliter et devot√®, et alii quamplurimi;
applaudentibus clero et populo, &amp;c., public√® fuimus in regem Angli√¶
inuncti et coronati." (p. 77.) I think that <i>magnates</i> is a collective
word, including the "alii quamplurimi." It appears to me that <i>magnates</i>,
and perhaps some other Latin words, correspond to the witan of the
Anglo-Saxons, expressing the legislature in general, under which were
comprised those who held peculiar dignities, whether lay or spiritual. And
upon the whole we may be led to believe that the Norman great council was
essentially of the same composition as the witenagemot which had preceded
it; the king's thanes being replaced by the barons of the first or second
degree, who, whatever may have been the distinction between them, shared
one common character, one source of their legislative rights&mdash;the
derivation of their lands as immediate fiefs from the crown.</p>

<p>The result of the whole inquiry into the constitution of parliament down
to the reign of John seems to be&mdash;1. That the Norman kings explicitly
renounced all prerogative of levying money on the immediate military
tenants of the crown, without their consent given in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> great council of
the realm; this immunity extending also to their sub-tenants and
dependants. 2. That all these tenants in chief had a constitutional right
to attend, and ought to be summoned; but whether they could attend without
a summons is not manifest. 3. That the summons was usually directed to the
higher barons, and to such of a second class as the king pleased, many
being omitted for different reasons, though all had a right to it. 4. That
on occasions when money was not to be demanded, but alterations made in
the law, some of these second barons, or tenants in chief, were at least
occasionally summoned, but whether by strict right or usage does not fully
appear. 5. That the irregularity of passing many of them over when
councils were held for the purpose of levying money, led to the provision
in the Great Charter of John by which the king promises that they shall
all be summoned through the sheriff on such occasions; but the promise
does not extend to any other subject of parliamentary deliberation. 6.
That even this concession, though but the recognition of a known right,
appeared so dangerous to some in the government that it was withdrawn in
the first charter of Henry III.</p>

<p>The charter of John, as has just been observed, while it removes all
doubt, if any could have been entertained, as to the right of every
military tenant <i>in capite</i> to be summoned through the sheriff, when an
aid or scutage was to be demanded, will not of itself establish their
right of attending parliament on other occasions. We cannot absolutely
assume any to have been, in a general sense, members of the legislature
except the prelates and the <i>majores barones</i>. But who were these, and how
distinguished? For distinguished they must now have become, and that by no
new provision, since none is made. The right of personal summons did not
constitute them, for it is on <i>majores barones</i>, as already a determinate
rank, that the right is conferred. The extent of property afforded no
definite criterion; at least some baronies, which appear to have been of
the first class, comprehended very few knights' fees: yet it seems
probable that this was the original ground of
distinction.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
The charter, as renewed in the first year of Henry III., does not only
omit the clause prohibiting the imposition of aids and scutages without
consent, and providing for the summons of all tenants <i>in capite</i> before
either could be levied, but gives the following reason for suspending this
and other articles of king John's charter:&mdash;"Quia vero qu√¶dam capitula in
priori cart√¢ continebantur, qu√¶ gravia et dubitabilia videbantur, <i>sicut
de scutagiis et auxiliis assidendis</i> ... placuit supra-dictis pr√¶latis et
magnatibus ea esse in respectu, quousque plenius consilium habuerimus, et
tunc faciemus plurissim√®, tam de his quam de aliis qu√¶ occurrerint
emendanda, qu√¶ ad communem omnium utilitatem pertinuerint, et pacem et
statum nostrum et regni nostri." This charter was made but twenty-four
days after the death of John; and we may agree with the committee (p. 77)
in thinking it extraordinary that these deviations from the charter of
Runnymede, in such important particulars, have been so little noticed. It
is worthy of consideration in what respects the provisions respecting the
levying of money could have appeared grave and doubtful. We cannot believe
that the earl of Pembroke, and the other barons who were with the young
king, himself a child of nine years old and incapable of taking a part,
meant to abandon the constitutional privilege of not being taxed in aids
without their consent. But this they might deem sufficiently provided for
by the charters of former kings and by general usage. It is not, however,
impossible that the government demurred to the prohibition of levying
scutage, which stood on a different footing from extraordinary aids; for
scutage appears to have been formerly taken without consent of the
tenants; and in the second charter of Henry III. there is a clause that it
should be taken as it had been in the time of Henry II. This was a certain
payment for every knight's fee; but if the original provision of the
Runnymede charter had been maintained, none could have been levied without
consent of parliament.</p>

<p>It seems also highly probable that, before the principle of representation
had been established, the greater barons looked with jealousy on the
equality of suffrage claimed by the inferior tenants <i>in capite</i>. That
these were constitutionally members of the great council, at least in
respect of taxation, has been sufficiently shown;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> but they had hitherto
come in small numbers, likely to act always in subordination to the more
potent aristocracy. It became another question whether they should all be
summoned, in their own counties, by a writ selecting no one through
favour, and in its terms compelling all to obey. And this question was
less for the crown, which might possibly find its advantage in the
disunion of its tenants, than for the barons themselves. They would
naturally be jealous of a second order, whom in their haughtiness they
held much beneath them, yet by whom they might be outnumbered in those
councils where they had bearded the king. No effectual or permanent
compromise could be made but by representation, and the hour for
representation was not come.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N3" id="N3"></a>Note</span> III. Page 19.</p>

<p>The Lords' committee, though not very confidently, take the view of Brady
and Blackstone, confining the electors of knights to tenants <i>in capite</i>.
They admit that "the subsequent usage, and the subsequent statutes founded
on that usage, afford ground for supposing that in the 49th of Henry III.
and in the reign of Edward I. the knights of the shires returned to
parliament were elected at the county courts and by the suitors of those
courts. If the knights of the shires were so elected in the reigns of
Henry III. and Edward I., it seems important to discover, if possible, who
were the suitors of the county courts in these reigns" (p. 149). The
subject, they are compelled to confess, after a discussion of some length,
remains involved in great obscurity, which their industry has been unable
to disperse. They had, however, in an earlier part of their report (p.
30), thought it highly probable that the knights of the shires in the
reign of Edward III. represented a description of persons who might in the
reign of the Conqueror have been termed barons. And the general spirit of
their subsequent investigation seems to favour this result, though they
finally somewhat recede from it, and admit at least that, before the close
of Edward III.'s reign, the elective franchise extended to freeholders.</p>

<p>The question, as the committee have stated it, will turn on the character
of those who were suitors to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
county court. And, if this may be
granted, I must own that to my apprehension there is no room for the
hypothesis that the county court was differently constituted in the reign
of Edward I. or of Edward III. from what it was very lately, and what it
was long before those princes sat on the throne. In the Anglo-Saxon period
we find this court composed of thanes, but not exclusively of royal
thanes, who were comparatively few. In the laws of Henry I. we still find
sufficient evidence that the suitors of the court were all who held
freehold lands, <i>terrarum domini</i>; or, even if we please to limit this to
lords of manors, which is not at all probable, still without distinction
of a mesne or immediate tenure. Vavassors, that is, mesne tenants, are
particularly mentioned in one enumeration of barons attending the court.
In some counties a limitation to tenants <i>in capite</i> would have left this
important tribunal very deficient in numbers. And as in all our law-books
we find the county court composed of freeholders, we may reasonably demand
evidence of two changes in its constitution, which the adherents to the
theory of restrained representation must combine&mdash;one which excluded all
freeholders except those who held immediately of the crown; another which
restored them. The notion that the county court was the king's court baron
(Report, p. 150), and thus bore an analogy to that of the lord in every
manor, whether it rests on any modern legal authority or not, seems
delusive. The court baron was essentially a feudal institution; the county
court was from a different source; it was old Teutonic, and subsisted in
this and other countries before the feudal jurisdictions had taken root.
It is a serious error to conceive that, because many great alterations
were introduced by the Normans, there was nothing left of the old system
of society.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>It may, however, be naturally inquired why, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> king's tenants in
chief were exclusively members of the national council before the era of
county representation, they did not retain that privilege; especially if
we conceive, as seems on the whole probable, that the knights chosen in 38
Henry III. were actually representatives of the military tenants of the
crown. The answer might be that these knights do not appear to have been
elected in the county court; and when that mode of choosing knights of the
shire was adopted, it was but consonant to the increasing spirit of
liberty, and to the weight also of the barons, whose tenants crowded the
court, that no freeholder should be debarred of his equal suffrage. But
this became the more important, and we might almost add necessary, when
the feudal aids were replaced by subsidies on movables; so that, unless
the mesne freeholders could vote at county elections, they would have been
taxed without their consent and placed in a worse condition than ordinary
burgesses. This of itself seems almost a decisive argument to prove that
they must have joined in the election of knights of the shire after the
<i>Confirmatio Chartarum</i>. If we were to go down so late as Richard II., and
some pretend that the mesne freeholders did not vote before the reign of
Henry IV., we find Chaucer's franklin, a vavassor, capable even of sitting
in parliament for his shire. For I do not think Chaucer ignorant of the
proper meaning of that word. And Allen says (Edinb. Rev. xxviii. 145)&mdash;"In
the earliest records of the house of commons we have found many instances
of sub-vassals who have represented their counties in parliament."</p>

<p>If, however, it should be suggested that the practice of admitting the
votes of mesne tenants at county elections may have crept in by degrees,
partly by the constitutional principle of common consent, partly on
account of the broad demarcation of tenants <i>in capite</i> by knight-service
from barons, which the separation of the houses of parliament produced,
thus tending, by diminishing the importance of the former, to bring them
down to the level of other freeholders; partly, also, through the
operation of the statute <i>Quia Emptores</i> (18 Edward I.), which, by putting
an end to subinfeudation, created a new tenant of the crown upon every
alienation of land, however partial, by one who was such already,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> and
thus both multiplied their numbers and lowered their dignity; this
supposition, though incompatible with the argument built on the nature of
the county court, would be sufficient to explain the facts, provided we do
not date the establishment of the new usage too low. The Lords' committee
themselves, after much wavering, come to the conclusion that "at length,
if not always, two persons were elected by all the freeholders of the
county, whether holding in chief of the crown or of others" (p. 331). This
they infer from the petitions of the commons that the mesne tenants should
be charged with the wages of knights of the shire; since it would not be
reasonable to levy such wages from those who had no voice in the election.
They ultimately incline to the hypothesis that the change came in
silently, favoured by the growing tendency to enlarge the basis of the
constitution, and by the operation of the statute <i>Quia Emptores</i>, which
may not have been of inconsiderable influence. It appears by a petition in
51 Edward III. that much confusion had arisen with respect to tenures; and
it was frequently disputed whether lands were held of the king or of other
lords. This question would often turn on the date of alienation; and, in
the hurry of an election, the bias being always in favour of an extended
suffrage, it is to be supposed that the sheriff would not reject a claim
to vote which he had not leisure to investigate.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N4" id="N4"></a>Note</span> IV. Page 21.</p>

<p>It now appears more probable to me than it did that some of the greater
towns, but almost unquestionably London, did enjoy the right of electing
magistrates with a certain jurisdiction before the Conquest. The notion
which I found prevailing among the writers of the last century, that the
municipal privileges of towns on the continent were merely derived from
charters of the twelfth century, though I was aware of some degree of
limitation which it required, swayed me too much in estimating the
condition of our own burgesses. And I must fairly admit that I have laid
too much stress on the silence of Domesday Book; which, as has been justly
pointed out, does not relate to matters of internal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> government, unless
when they involve some rights of property.</p>

<p>I do not conceive, nevertheless, that the municipal government of
Anglo-Saxon boroughs was analogous to that generally established in our
corporations from the reign of Henry II. and his successors. The real
presumption has been acutely indicated by Sir F. Palgrave, arising from
the universal institution of the court-leet, which gave to an alderman, or
otherwise denominated officer, chosen by the suitors, a jurisdiction, in
conjunction with themselves as a jury, over the greater part of civil
disputes and criminal accusations, as well as general police, that might
arise within the hundred. Wherever the town or borough was too large to be
included within a hundred, this would imply a distinct jurisdiction, which
may of course be called municipal. It would be similar to that which, till
lately, existed in some towns&mdash;an elective high bailiff or principal
magistrate, without a representative body of aldermen and councillors. But
this is more distinctly proved with respect to London, which, as is well
known, does not appear in Domesday, than as to any other town. It was
divided into wards, answering to hundreds in the county; each having its
own wardmote, or leet, under its elected alderman. "The city of London, as
well within the walls, as its liberties without the walls, has been
divided from time immemorial into wards, bearing nearly the same relation
to the city that the hundred anciently did to the shire. Each ward is, for
certain purposes, a distinct jurisdiction. The organisation of the
existing municipal constitution of the city is, and always has been, as
far as can be traced, entirely founded upon the ward system."
(Introduction to the French Chronicle of London.&mdash;Camden Society, 1844.)</p>

<p>Sir F. Palgrave extends this much further:&mdash;"There were certain districts
locally included within the hundreds, which nevertheless constituted
independent bodies politic. The burgesses, the tenants, the resiants of
the king's burghs and manors in ancient demesne, owed neither suit nor
service to the hundred leet. They attended at their own leet, which
differed in no essential respect from the leet of the hundred. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
principle of frank-pledge required that each friborg should appear by its
head as its representative; and consequently, the jurymen of the leet of
the burgh or manor are usually described under the style of the twelve
chief pledges. The legislative and remedial assembly of the burgh or manor
was constituted by the meeting of the heads of its component parts. The
portreeve, constable, headborough, bailiff, or other the chief executive
magistrate, was elected or presented by the leet jury. Offences against
the law were repressed by their summary presentments. They who were
answerable to the community for the breach of the peace punished the
crime. Responsibility and authority were conjoined. In their legislative
capacity they bound their fellow-townsmen by making by-laws." (Edin. Rev.
xxxvi. 309.) "Domesday Book," he says afterwards, "does not notice the
hundred court, or the county-court; because it was unnecessary to inform
the king or his justiciaries of the existence of the tribunals which were
in constant action throughout all the land. It was equally unnecessary to
make a return of the leets which they knew to be inherent in every burgh.
Where any special municipal jurisdiction existed, as in Chester, Stamford,
and Lincoln, then it became necessary that the franchise should be
recorded. The twelve lagemen in the two latter burghs were probably
hereditary aldermen. In London and in Canterbury aldermen occasionally
held their sokes by inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
The negative evidence extorted out of Domesday has, therefore, little weight." (p. 313.)</p>

<p>It seems, however, not unquestionable whether this representation of an
Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman municipality is not urged rather beyond the
truth. The portreeve of London, their principal magistrate, appears to
have been appointed by the crown. It was not till 1188 that Henry
Fitzalwyn, ancestor of the present Lord
Beaumont,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
became the first mayor of London. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
he also was nominated by the crown, and remained
twenty-four years in office. In the same year the first sheriffs are said
to have been made (<i>facti</i>). But John, immediately after his accession in
1199, granted the citizens leave to choose their own sheriffs. And his
charter of 1215 permits them to elect annually their mayor. (Maitland's
Hist. of London, p. 74, 76.) We read, however, under the year 1200, in the
ancient chronicle lately published, that twenty-five of the most discreet
men of the city were chosen and sworn to advise for the city, together
with the mayor. These were evidently different from the aldermen, and are
the original common council of the city. They were perhaps meant in a
later entry (1229):&mdash;"Omnes aldermanni et magnates civitatis per assensum
universorum civium," who are said to have agreed never to permit a sheriff
to remain in office during two consecutive years.</p>

<p>The city and liberties of London were not wholly under the jurisdiction of
the several wardmotes and their aldermen. Landholders, secular and
ecclesiastical, possessed their exclusive sokes, or jurisdictions, in
parts of both. One of these has left its name to the ward of Portsoken.
The prior of the Holy Trinity, in right of this district, ranked as an
alderman, and held a regular wardmote. The wards of Farringdon are
denominated from a family of that name, who held a part of them by
hereditary right as their territorial franchise. These sokes gave way so
gradually before the power of the citizens, with whom, as may be supposed,
a perpetual conflict was maintained, that there were nearly thirty of them
in the early part of the reign of Henry III., and upwards of twenty in
that of Edward I. With the exception of Portsoken, they were not
commensurate with the city wards, and we find the juries of the wards, in
the third of Edward I., presenting the sokes as liberties enjoyed by
private persons or ecclesiastical corporations, to the detriment of the
crown. But, though the lords of these sokes trenched materially on the
exclusive privileges of the city, it is remarkable that, no condition but
inhabitancy being required in the thirteenth century for civic franchises,
both they and their tenants were citizens, having individually a voice in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
municipal affairs, though exempt from municipal jurisdiction. I have taken
most of this paragraph from a valuable though short notice of the state of
London in the thirteenth century, published in the fourth volume of the
Arch√¶ological Journal (p. 273).</p>

<p>The inference which suggests itself from these facts is that London, for
more than two centuries after the Conquest, was not so exclusively a city
of traders, a democratic municipality, as we have been wont to conceive.
And as this evidently extends back to the Anglo-Saxon period, it both
lessens the improbability that the citizens bore at times a part in
political affairs, and exhibits them in a new light, as lords and tenants
of lords, as well as what of course they were in part, engaged in foreign
and domestic commerce. It will strike every one, in running over the list
of mayors and sheriffs in the thirteenth century, that a large proportion
of the names are French; indicating, perhaps, that the territorial
proprietors whose sokes were intermingled with the city had influence
enough, through birth and wealth, to obtain an election. The general
polity, Saxon and Norman, was aristocratic; whatever infusion there might
be of a more popular scheme of government, and much certainly there was,
could not resist, even if resistance had been always the people's desire,
the joint predominance of rank, riches, military habits, and common
alliance, which the great baronage of the realm enjoyed. London,
nevertheless, from its populousness, and the usual character of cities,
was the centre of a democratic power, which, bursting at times into
precipitate and needless tumult easily repressed by force, kept on its
silent course till, near the end of the thirteenth century, the rights of
the citizens and burgesses in the legislature were constitutionally
established. [1848.]</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N5" id="N5"></a>Note</span> V. Page 26.</p>

<p>If Fitz-Stephen rightly informs us that in London there were 126 parish
churches, besides 13 conventual ones, we may naturally think the population much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
underrated at 40,000. But the fashion of building
churches in cities was so general, that we cannot apply a standard from
modern times. Norwich contained sixty parishes.</p>

<p>Even under Henry II., as we find by Fitz-Stephen, the prelates and nobles
had town houses. "Ad h√¶c omnes fere episcopi, abbates, et magnates Angli√¶,
quasi cives et municipes sunt urbis Lundoni√¶; sua ibi habentes √¶dificia
pr√¶clara; ubi se recipiunt, ubi divites impensas faciunt, ad concilia, ad
conventus celebres in urbem evocati, √† domino rege vel metropolitano suo,
seu propriis tracti negotiis." The eulogy of London by this writer is very
curious; its citizens were thus early distinguished by their good eating,
to which they added amusements less congenial to later liverymen, hawking,
cock-fighting, and much more. The word <i>cockney</i> is not improbably derived
from <i>cocayne</i>, the name of an imaginary land of ease and jollity.</p>

<p>The city of London within the walls was not wholly built, many gardens and
open spaces remaining. And the houses were never more than a single story
above the ground-floor, according to the uniform type of English dwellings
in the twelfth and following centuries. On the other hand, the liberties
contained many inhabitants; the streets were narrower than since the fire
of 1666; and the vast spaces now occupied by warehouses might have been
covered by dwelling-houses. Forty thousand, on the whole, seems rather a
low estimate for these two centuries; but it is impossible to go beyond
the vaguest conjecture.</p>

<p>The population of Paris in the middle ages has been estimated with as much
diversity as that of London. M. Dulaure, on the basis of the <i>taille</i> in
1313, reckons the inhabitants at
49,110.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
But he seems to have made
unwarrantable assumptions where his data were deficient. M. Gu√©rard, on
the other hand (Documens In√©dits, 1841), after long calculations, brings
the population of the city in 1292 to 215,861. This is certainly very much
more than we could assign to London, or probably any European city; and,
in fact, his estimate goes on two arbitrary postulates. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> extent of
Paris in that age, which is tolerably known, must be decisive against so
high a population.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[h]</a></p>

<p>The Winton Domesday, in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries of
London, furnishes some important information as to that city, which, as
well as London, does not appear in the great Domesday Book. This record is
of the reign of Henry I. Winchester had been, as is well known, the
capital of the Anglo-Saxon kings. It has been observed that "the opulence
of the inhabitants may possibly be gathered from the frequent recurrence
of the trade of goldsmith in it, and the populousness of the town from the
enumeration of the streets." (Cooper's Public Records, i. 226.) Of these
we find sixteen. "In the petition from the city of Winchester to king
Henry VI. in 1450, no less than nine of these streets are mentioned as
having been ruined." As York appears to have contained about 10,000
inhabitants under the Confessor, we may probably compute the population of
Winchester at nearly twice that number.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N6" id="N6"></a>Note</span> VI. Page 32.</p>

<p>The Lords' committee extenuate the presumption that either knights or
burgesses sat in any of these parliaments. The "cunctarum regni civitatum
pariter et burgorum potentiores," mentioned by Wikes in 1269 or 1270, they
suppose to have been invited in order to witness the ceremony of
translating the body of Edward the Confessor to his tomb newly prepared in
Westminster Abbey (p. 161). It is evident, indeed, that this assembly
acted afterwards as a parliament in levying money. But the burgesses are
not mentioned in this. It cannot, nevertheless, be presumed from the
silence of the historian, who had previously informed us of their presence
at Westminster, that they took no part. It may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> perhaps, more doubtful
whether they were chosen by their constituents or merely summoned as
"potentiores."</p>

<p>The words of the statute of Marlbridge (51 Hen. III.), which are repeated
in French by that of Gloucester (6 Edw. I.), do not satisfy the committee
that there was any representation either of counties or boroughs. "They
rather import a selection by the king of the most discreet men of every
degree" (p. 183). And the statutes of 13 Edw. I., referring to this of
Gloucester, assert it to have been made by the king, "with prelates,
earls, barons, and his council," thus seeming to exclude what would
afterwards have been called the lower house. The assembly of 1271,
described in the Annals of Waverley, "seems to have been an extraordinary
convention, warranted rather by the particular circumstances under which
the country was placed than by any constitutional law" (p. 173). It was,
however, a case of representation; and following several of the like
nature, at least as far as counties were concerned, would render the
principle familiar. The committee are even unwilling to admit that "la
communaut√© de la terre illocques summons" in the statute of Westminster
I., though expressly distinguished from the prelates, earls, and barons,
appeared in consequence of election (p. 173). But, if not elected, we
cannot suppose less than that all the tenants in chief, or a large number
of them, were summoned; which, after the experience of representation, was
hardly a probable course.</p>

<p>The Lords' committee, I must still incline to think, have gone too far
when they come to the conclusion that, on the whole view of the evidence
collected on the subject, from the 49th of Hen. III. to the 18th of Edw.
I., there seems strong ground for presuming that, after the 49th of Hen.
III., the constitution of the legislative assembly returned generally to
its old course; that the writs issued in the 49th of Henry III., being a
novelty, were not afterwards precisely followed, as far as appears, in any
instance; and that the writs issued in the 11th of Edw. I., "for
assembling two conventions, at York and Northampton, of knights, citizens,
burgesses, and representatives of towns, without prelates, earls, and
barons, were an extraordinary measure, probably adopted for the occasion,
and never afterwards followed; and that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> writs issued in the 18th of
Edw. I., for electing two or three knights for each shire without
corresponding writs for election of citizens or burgesses, and not
directly founded on or conformable to the writs issued in the 49th of
Henry III., were probably adopted for a particular purpose, possibly to
sanction one important law [the statute <i>Quia Emptores</i>], and because the
smaller tenants in chief of the crown rarely attended the ordinary
legislative assemblies when summoned, or attended in such small numbers
that a representation of them by knights chosen for the whole shire was
deemed advisable, to give sanction to a law materially affecting all the
tenants in chief, and those holding under them" (p. 204).</p>

<p>The election of two or three knights for the parliament of 18th Edw. I.,
which I have overlooked in my text, appears by an entry on the close roll
of that year, directed to the sheriff of Northumberland; and it is proved
from the same roll that similar writs were directed to all the sheriffs in
England. We do not find that the citizens and burgesses were present in
this parliament; and it is reasonably conjectured that, the object of
summoning it being to procure a legislative consent to the statute <i>Quia
Emptores</i>, which put an end to the subinfeudation of lands, the towns were
thought to have little interest in the measure. It is, however, another
early precedent for county representation; and that of 22nd of Edw. I.
(see the writ in Report of Committee, p. 209) is more regular. We do not
find that the citizens and burgesses were summoned to either parliament.</p>

<p>But, after the 23rd of Edward I., the legislative constitution seems not
to have been unquestionably settled, even in the essential point of
taxation. The Confirmation of the Charters, in the 25th year of that
reign, while it contained a positive declaration that no "aids, tasks, or
prises should be levied in future, without assent of the realm," was made
in consideration of a grant made by an assembly in which representatives
of cities and boroughs do not appear to have been present. Yet, though the
words of the charter or statute are prospective, it seems to have long
before been reckoned a clear right of the subject, at least by himself,
not to be taxed without his consent. A tallage on royal towns and
demesnes, nevertheless, was set without authority of parliament four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
years afterwards. This "seems to show, either that the king's right to tax
his demesnes at his pleasure was not intended to be included in the word
tallage in that statute [meaning the supposed statute <i>de tallagio non
concedendo</i>], or that the king acted in contravention of it. But if the
king's cities and boroughs were still liable to tallage at the will of the
crown, it may not have been deemed inconsistent that they should be
required to send representatives for the purpose of granting a general aid
to be assessed on the same cities and boroughs, together with the rest of
the kingdom, when such general aid was granted, and yet should be liable
to be tallaged at the will of the crown when no such general aid was
granted" (p. 244).</p>

<p>If in these later years of Edward's reign the king could venture on so
strong a measure as the imposition of a tallage without consent of those
on whom it was levied, it is less surprising that no representatives of
the commons appear to have been summoned to one parliament, or perhaps
two, in his twenty-seventh year, when some statutes were enacted. But, as
this is merely inferred from the want of any extant writ, which is also
the case in some parliaments where, from other sources, we can trace the
commons to have been present, little stress should be laid upon it.</p>

<p>In the remarks which I have offered in these notes on the Report of the
Lords' Committee, I have generally abstained from repeating any which Mr.
Allen brought forward. But the reader should have recourse to his learned
criticism in the Edinburgh Review. It will appear that the committee
overlooked not a few important records, both in the reign of Edward I. and
that of his son.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N7" id="N7"></a>Note</span> VII. Page 35.</p>

<p>Two considerable authorities have, since the first publication of this
work, placed themselves, one very confidently, one much less so, on the
side of our older lawyers and in favour of the antiquity of borough
representation. Mr. Allen, who, in his review of my volumes (Edinb. Rev.
xxx. 169), observes, as to this point,&mdash;"We are inclined, in the main, to agree with Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Hallam," lets us know, two or three years afterwards, that
the scale was tending the other way, when, in his review of the Report of
the Lords' Committee, who give a decided opinion that cities and boroughs
were on no occasion called upon to assist at legislative meetings before
the forty-ninth of Henry III., and are much disposed to believe that none
were originally summoned to parliament, except cities and boroughs of
ancient demesne, or in the hands of the king at the time when they
received the summons, he says,&mdash;"We are inclined to doubt the first of
these propositions, and convinced that the latter is entirely erroneous."
(Edinb. Rev. xxxv. 30.) He allows, however, that our kings had no motive
to summon their cities and boroughs to the legislature, for the purpose of
obtaining money, "this being procured through the justices in eyre, or
special commissioners; and therefore, if summoned at all, it is probable
that the citizens and burgesses were assembled on particular occasions
only, when their assistance or authority was wanted to confirm or
establish the measures in contemplation by the government." But as he
alleges no proof that this was ever done, and merely descants on the
importance of London and other cities both before and after the Conquest,
and as such an occasional summons to a great council, for the purpose of
advice, would by no means involve the necessity of legislative consent, we
can hardly reckon this very acute writer among the positive advocates of a
high antiquity for the commons in parliament.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Palgrave has taken much higher ground, and his theory, in part
at least, would have been hailed with applause by the parliaments of
Charles I. According to this, we are not to look to feudal principles for
our great councils of advice and consent. They were the aggregate of
representatives from the courts-leet of each shire and each borough, and
elected by the juries to present the grievances of the people and to
suggest their remedies. The assembly summoned by William the Conqueror
appears to him not only, as it did to lord Hale, "a sufficient
parliament," but a regular one; "proposing the law and giving the
initiation to the bill which required the king's consent." (Ed. Rev.
xxxvi. 327.) "We cannot," he proceeds, "discover any essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
difference between the powers of these juries and the share of the legislative
authority which was enjoyed by the commons at a period when the
constitution assumed a more tangible shape and form." This is supported
with that copiousness and variety of illustration which distinguish his
theories, even when there hangs over them something not quite satisfactory
to a rigorous inquirer, and when their absolute originality on a subject
so beaten is of itself reasonably suspicious. Thus we come in a few pages
to the conclusion&mdash;"Certainly there is no theory so improbable, so
irreconcilable to general history or to the peculiar spirit of our
constitution, as the opinions which are held by those who deny the
substantial antiquity of the house of commons. No paradox is so startling
as the assumption that the knights and burgesses who stole into the great
council between the close of the reign of John and the beginning of the
reign of Edward should convert themselves at once into the third estate of
the realm, and stand before the king and his peers in possession of powers
and privileges which the original branches of the legislature could
neither dispute nor withstand" (p. 332). "It must not be forgotten that
the researches of all previous writers have been directed wholly in
furtherance of the opinions which have been held respecting the feudal
origin of parliament. No one has considered it as a common-law court."</p>

<p>I do not know that it is necessary to believe in a properly feudal
<i>origin</i> of parliament, or that this hypothesis is generally received. The
great council of the Norman kings was, as in common with Sir F. Palgrave
and many others I believe, little else than a continuation of the
witenagemot, the immemorial organ of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy in their
relation to the king. It might be composed, perhaps, more strictly
according to feudal principles; but the royal thanes had always been
consenting parties. Of the representation of courts-leet we may require
better evidence: aldermen of London, or persons bearing that name, perhaps
as landowners rather than citizens (see a former note), may possibly have
been occasionally present; but it is remarkable that neither in historians
nor records do we find this mentioned; that aldermen, in the municipal
sense, are never enumerated among the constituents of a witenagemot or a council,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
though they must, on the representative theory, have composed a
large portion of both. But, waiving this hypothesis, which the author
seems not here to insist upon, though he returns to it in the Rise and
Progress of the English Commonwealth, why is it "a startling paradox to
deny the substantial antiquity of the house of commons"? By this I
understand him to mean that representatives from counties and boroughs
came regularly, or at least frequently, to the great councils of Saxon and
Norman kings. Their indispensable consent in legislation I do not
apprehend him to affirm, but rather the reverse:&mdash;"The supposition that in
any early period the burgesses had a voice in the solemn acts of the
legislature is untenable." (Rise and Progress, &amp;c., i. 314.) But they
certainly did, at one time or other, obtain this right, "or convert
themselves," as he expresses it, "into the third estate of the realm;" so
that upon any hypothesis a great constitutional change was wrought in the
powers of the commons. The revolutionary character of Montfort's
parliament in the 49th of Hen. III. would sufficiently account both for
the appearance of representatives from a democracy so favourable to that
bold reformer and for the equality of power with which it was probably
designed to invest them. But whether in the more peaceable times of Edward
I. the citizens or burgesses were recognised as essential parties to every
legislative measure, may, as I have shown, be open to much doubt.</p>

<p>I cannot upon the whole overcome the argument from the silence of all
historians, from the deficiency of all proof as to any presence of
citizens and burgesses, in a representative character as a house of
commons, before the 49th year of Henry III.; because after this time
historians and chroniclers exactly of the same character as the former, or
even less copious and valuable, do not omit to mention it. We are
accustomed in the sister kingdoms, so to speak, of the continent, founded
on the same Teutonic original, to argue against the existence of
representative councils, or other institutions, from the same absence of
positive testimony. No one believes that the three estates of France were
called together before the time of Philip the Fair. No one strains the
representation of cities in the cortes of Castile beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> date at
which we discover its existence by testimony. It is true that unreasonable
inferences may be made from what is usually called negative evidence; but
how readily and how often are we deceived by a reliance on testimony! In
many instances the negative conclusion carries with it a conviction equal
to a great mass of affirmative proof. And such I reckon the inference from
the language of Roger Hoveden, of Matthew Paris, and so many more who
speak of councils and parliaments full of prelates and nobles, without a
syllable of the burgesses. Either they were absent, or they were too
insignificant to be named; and in that case it is hard to perceive any
motive for requiring their attendance.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N8" id="N8"></a>Note</span> VIII. Page 42.</p>

<p>A record, which may be read in Brady's History of England (vol. ii.
Append. p. 66) and in Rymer (t. iv. p. 1237), relative to the proceedings
on Edward II.'s flight into Wales and subsequent detention, recites that,
"the king having left his kingdom without government, and gone away with
notorious enemies of the queen, prince, and realm, divers prelates, earls,
barons, and knights, then being at Bristol in the presence of the said
queen and duke (prince Edward, duke of Cornwall), <i>by the assent of the
whole commonalty of the realm there being</i>, unanimously elected the said
duke to be guardian of the said kingdom; so that the said duke and
guardian should rule and govern the said realm in the name and by the
authority of the king his father, he being thus absent." But the king
being taken and brought back into England, the power thus delegated to the
guardian ceased of course; whereupon the bishop of Hereford was sent to
press the king to permit that the great seal, which he had with him, the
prince having only used his private seal, should be used in all things
that required it. Accordingly the king sent the great seal to the queen
and prince. The bishop is said to have been thus commissioned to fetch the
seal by the prince and queen, and by the said prelates and peers, <i>with
the assent of the said commonalty then being at Hereford</i>. It is plain
that these were mere words of course; for no parliament had been convoked, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
proper representatives could have been either at Bristol or
Hereford. However, this is a very curious record, inasmuch as it proves
the importance attached to the forms of the constitution at this period.</p>

<p>The Lords' committee dwell much on an enactment in the parliament held at
York in 15 Edw. II. (1322), which they conceived to be the first express
recognition of the constitutional powers of the lower house. It was there
enacted that "for ever thereafter all manner of ordinances or provisions
made by the subjects of the king or his heirs, by any power or authority
whatsoever, concerning the royal power of the king or his heirs, or
against the estate of the crown, should be void and of no avail or force
whatsoever; but the matters to be established for the estate of the king
and of his heirs, and for the estate of the realm and of the people,
should be treated, accorded, and established in parliament by the king,
and by the assent of the prelates, earls, and barons, and the commonalty
of the realm, according as had been before accustomed. This proceeding,
therefore, declared the legislative authority to reside only in the king,
with the assent of the prelates, earls, and barons, and commons assembled
in parliament; and that every legislative act not done by that authority
should be deemed void and of no effect. By whatever violence this statute
may have been obtained, it declared the constitutional law of the realm on
this important subject." (p. 282.) The violence, if resistance to the
usurpation of a subject is to be called such, was on the part of the king,
who had just sent the earl of Lancaster to the scaffold, and the present
enactment was levelled at the ordinances which had been forced upon the
crown by his faction. The lords ordainers, nevertheless, had been
appointed with consent of the commons, as has been mentioned in the text;
so that this provision in 15 Edward II. seems rather to limit than to
enhance the supreme power of parliament, if it were meant to prohibit any
future enactment of the same kind by its sole authority. But the statute
is declaratory in its nature; nor can we any more doubt that the
legislative authority was reposed in the king, lords, and commons before
this era than that it was so ever afterwards. Unsteady as the
constitutional usage had been through the reign of Edward I., and willing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
both he and his son may have been to prevent its complete
establishment, the necessity of parliamentary consent both for levying
money and enacting laws must have become an article of the public creed
before his death. If it be true that even after this declaratory statute
laws were made without the assent or presence of the commons, as the
Lords' committee incline to hold (p. 285, 286, 287), it was undeniably an
irregular and unconstitutional proceeding; but this can only show that we
ought to be very slow in presuming earlier proceedings of the same nature
to have been more conformable to the spirit of the existing constitution.
The Lords' committee too often reason from the fact to the right, as well
as from the words to the fact; both are fallacious, and betray them into
some vacillation and perplexity. They do not, however, question, on the
whole, but that a new constitution of the legislative assemblies of the
realm had been introduced before the 15th year of Edward II., and that
"the practice had prevailed so long before as to give it, in the opinion
of the parliament then assembled, the force and effect of a custom, which
the parliament declared should thereafter be considered as established
law." (p. 293.) This appears to me rather an inadequate exposition of the
public spirit, of the tendency towards enlarging the basis of the
constitution, to which the "practice and custom" owed its origin; but the
positive facts are truly stated.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N9" id="N9"></a>Note</span> IX. Page 124.</p>

<p>Writs are addressed in 11th of Edw. II. "comitibus, majoribus baronibus,
et pr√¶latis," whence the Lords' committee infer that the style used in
John's charter was still preserved (Report, p. 277). And though in those
times there might be much irregularity in issuing writs of summons, the
term "majores barones" must have had an application to definite persons.
Of the irregularity we may judge by the fact that under Edward I. about
eighty were generally summoned; under his son never so many as fifty,
sometimes less than forty, as may be seen in Dugdale's Summonitiones ad
Parliamentum. The committee endeavour to draw an inference from this
against a subsisting right of tenure. But if it is meant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> that the king
had an acknowledged prerogative of omitting any baron at his discretion,
the higher English nobility must have lost its notorious privileges,
sanctioned by long usage, by the analogy of all feudal governments, and by
the charter of John, which, though not renewed in terms, nor intended to
be retained in favour of the lesser barons, or tenants <i>in capite</i>, could
not, relatively to the rights of the superior order, have been designedly
relinquished.</p>

<p>The committee wish to get rid of tenure as conferring a right to summons;
they also strongly doubt whether the summons conferred an hereditary
nobility; but they assert that, in the 15th of Edward III., "those who may
have been deemed to have been in the reign of John distinguished as
<i>majores barones</i> by the honour of a personal writ of summons, or by the
extent and influence of their property, from the other tenants in chief of
the crown, were now clearly become, with the earls and the newly created
dignity of duke, a distinct body of men denominated peers of the land, and
having distinct personal rights; while the other tenants in chief,
whatsoever their rights may have been in the reign of John, sunk into the
general mass." (p. 314.)</p>

<p>The appellation "peers of the land" is said to occur for the first time in
14 Edw. II. (p. 281), and we find them very distinctly in the proceedings
against Bereford and others at the beginning of the next reign. They were,
of course, entitled to trial by their own order. But whether all laymen
summoned by particular writs to parliament were at that time considered as
peers, and triable by the rest as such, must be questionable; unless we
could assume that the writ of summons already ennobled the blood, which is
at least not the opinion of the committee. If, therefore, the writ did not
constitute an hereditary peer, nor tenure in chief by barony give a right
to sit in parliament, we should have a difficulty in finding any
determinate estate of nobility at all, exclusive of earls, who were, at
all times and without exception, indisputably noble; an hypothesis
manifestly paradoxical, and contradicted by history and law. If it be said
that prescription was the only title, this may be so far granted that the
<i>majores barones</i> had by prescription, antecedent to any statute or
charter, been summoned to parliament:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
but this prescription would not be
broken by the omission, through negligence or policy, of an individual
tenant by barony in a few parliaments. The prescription was properly in
favour of the class, the <i>majores barones</i> generally, and as to them it
was perfect, extending itself in right, if not always in fact, to every
one who came within its scope.</p>

<p>In the Third Report of the Lords' Committee, apparently drawn by the same
hand as the Second, they "conjecture that after the establishment of the
commons' house of parliament as a body by election, separate and distinct
from the lords, all idea of a right to a writ of summons to parliament by
reason of tenure had ceased, and that the dignity of baron, if not
conferred by patent, was considered as derived only from the king's writ
of summons." (Third Report, p. 226.) Yet they have not only found many
cases of persons summoned by writ several times whose descendants have not
been summoned, and hesitate even to approve the decision of the house on
the Clifton barony in 1673, when it was determined that the claimant's
ancestor, by writ of summons and sitting in parliament, was a peer, but
doubt whether "even at this day the doctrine of that case ought to be
considered as generally applicable, or may be limited by time and
circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> (p. 33.)</p>

<p>It seems, with much deference to more learned investigators, rather
improbable that, either before or after the regular admission of the
knights and burgesses by representation, and consequently the constitution
of a distinct lords' house of parliament, a writ of summons could have
been lawfully withheld at the king's pleasure from any one holding such
lands by barony as rendered him notoriously one of the <i>majores barones</i>.
Nor will this be much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
affected by arguments from the inexpediency or
supposed anomaly of permitting the right of sitting as a peer of
parliament to be transferred by alienation. The Lords' committee dwell at
length upon them. And it is true that, in our original feudal
constitution, the fiefs of the crown could not be alienated without its
consent. But when this was obtained, when a barony had passed by purchase,
it would naturally draw with it, as an incident of tenure, the privilege
of being summoned to parliament, or, in language more accustomed in those
times, the obligation of doing suit and service to the king in his high
court. Nor was the alienee, doubtless, to be taxed without his own
consent, any more than another tenant <i>in capite</i>. What incongruity,
therefore, is there in the supposition that, after tenants in fee simple
acquired by statute the power of alienation without previous consent of
the crown, the new purchaser stood on the same footing in all other
respects as before the statute? It is also much to be observed that the
claim to a summons might be gained by some methods of purchase, using that
word, of course, in the legal sense. Thus the husbands of heiresses of
baronies were frequently summoned, and sat as tenants by courtesy after
the wife's death; though it must be owned that the committee doubt, in
their Third Report (p. 47), whether tenancy by courtesy of a dignity was
ever allowed as a right. Thus, too, every estate created in tail male was
a diversion of the inheritance by the owner's sole will from its course
according to law. Yet in the case of the barony of Abergavenny, even so
late as the reign of James I., the heir male, being in seisin of the
lands, was called by writ as baron, to the exclusion of the heir general.
Surely this was an authentic recognition, not only of baronial tenure as
the foundation of a right to sit in parliament, but of its alienability by
the tenant.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<p>If it be asked whether the posterity of a baron aliening the lands which
gave him a right to be summoned to the king's court would be entitled to
the privileges of peerage by nobility of blood, it is true that, according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
to Collins, whose opinion the committee incline to follow,
there are instances of persons in such circumstances being summoned. But
this seems not to prove anything to the purpose. The king, no one doubts,
from the time of Edward I., used to summon by writ many who had no
baronial tenure; and the circumstance of having alienated a barony could
not render any one incapable of attending parliament by a different title.
It is very hard to determine any question as to times of much
irregularity; but it seems that the posterity of one who had parted with
his baronial lands would not, in those early times, as a matter of course,
remain noble. A right by tenure seems to exclude a right by blood; not
necessarily, because two collateral titles may coexist, but in the
principle of the constitution. A feudal principle was surely the more
ancient; and what could be more alien to this than a baron, a peer, an
hereditary counsellor, without a fief? Nobility, that is, gentility of
birth, might be testified by a pedigree or a bearing; but a peer was to be
in arms for the crown, to grant his own money as well as that of others,
to lead his vassals, to advise, to exhort, to restrain the sovereign. The
new theory came in by degrees, but in the decay of every feudal idea; it
was the substitution of a different pride of aristocracy for that of
baronial wealth and power; a pride nourished by heralds, more peaceable,
more indolent, more accommodated to the rules of fixed law and vigorous
monarchy. It is difficult to trace the progress of this theory, which
rested on nobility of blood, but yet so remarkably modified by the
original principle of tenure, that the privileges of this nobility were
ever confined to the actual possessor, and did not take his kindred out of
the class of commoners. This sufficiently demonstrates that the phrase is,
so to say, catachrestic, not used in a proper sense; inasmuch as the
actual seisin of the peerage as an hereditament, whether by writ or by
patent, is as much requisite at present for nobility, as the seisin of an
estate by barony was in the reign of Henry III.</p>

<p>Tenure by barony appears to have been recognised by the house of lords in
the reign of Henry VI., when the earldom of Arundel was claimed as annexed
to the "castle, honour, and lordship aforesaid." The Lords'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> committee
have elaborately disproved the allegations of descent and tenure, on which
this claim was allowed. (Second Report, p. 406-426.) But all with which we
are concerned is the decision of the crown and of the house in the 11th
year of Henry VI., whether it were right or wrong as to the particular
facts of the case. And here we find that the king, by the advice and
assent of the lords, "considering that Richard Fitzalan, &amp;c., was seised
of the castle, honour, and lordship in fee, and by reason of his
possession thereof, without any other reason or creation, was earl of
Arundel, and held the name, style, and honour of earl of Arundel, and the
place and seat of earl of Arundel in parliament and councils of the king,"
&amp;c., admits him to the same seat and place as his ancestors, earls of
Arundel, had held. This was long afterwards confirmed by act of parliament
(3 Car. I.), reciting the dignity of earl of Arundel to be real and local,
&amp;c., and settling the title on certain persons in tail, with provisions
against alienation of the castle and honour. This appears to establish a
tenure by barony in Arundel, as a recent determination had done in
Abergavenny. Arundel was a very peculiar instance of an earldom by tenure.
For we cannot doubt that all earls were peers of parliament by virtue of
that rank, though, in fact, all held extensive lands of the crown. But in
1669 a new doctrine, which probably had long been floating among lawyers
and in the house of lords, was laid down by the king in council on a claim
to the title of Fitzwalter. The nature of a barony by tenure having been
discussed, it was found "to have been discontinued for many ages, and not
in being" (a proposition not very tenable, if we look at the Abergavenny
case, even setting aside that of Arundel as peculiar in its character, and
as settled by statute); "and so not fit to be received, or to admit any
pretence of right to succession thereto." It is fair to observe that some
eminent judges were present on this occasion. The committee justly say
that "this decision" (which, after all, was not in the house of lords)
"may perhaps be considered as amounting to a solemn opinion that, although
in early times the right to a writ of summons to parliament as a baron may
have been founded on tenure, a contrary practice had prevailed for ages, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
that, therefore, it was not to be taken as then forming part of the
constitutional law of the land." (p. 446.) Thus ended barony by tenure.
The final decision, for such it has been considered, and recent attempts
to revive the ancient doctrine have been defeated, has prevented many
tedious investigations of claims to baronial descent, and of alienations
in times long past. For it could not be pretended that every fraction of a
barony gave a right to summons; and, on the other hand, alienations of
parcels, and descents to coparceners, must have been common, and sometimes
difficult to disprove. It was held, indeed, by some, that the <i>caput
baroni√¶</i>, or principal lordship, contained, as it were, the vital
principle of the peerage, and that its owner was the true baron; but this
assumption seems uncertain.</p>

<p>It is not very easy to reconcile this peremptory denial of peerage by
tenure with the proviso in the recent statute taking away tenure by
knight-service, and, inasmuch as it converts all tenure into socage, that
also by barony, "that this act shall not infringe or hurt any title of
honour, feudal or other, by which any person hath or may have right to sit
in the lords' house of parliament, as to his or their title of honour, or
sitting in parliament, and the privilege belonging to them as peers."
(Stat. 12 Car. II. c. 24, s. 11.)</p>

<p>Surely this clause was designed to preserve the incident to baronial
tenure, the privilege of being summoned to parliament, while it destroyed
its original root, the tenure itself. The privy council, in their decision
on the Fitzwalter claim, did not allude to this statute, probably on
account of the above proviso, and seem to argue that, if tenure by barony
was no longer in being, the privilege attached to it must have been
extinguished also. It is, however, observable that tenure by barony is not
taken away by the statute, except by implication. No act indeed can be
more loosely drawn than this, which was to change essentially the
condition of landed property throughout the kingdom. It literally
abolishes all tenure <i>in capite</i>; though this is the basis of the crown's
right to escheat, and though lands in common socage, which the act with a
strange confusion opposes to socage <i>in capite</i>, were as much holden of
the king or other lord as those by knight-service. Whether it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
intended by the silence about tenure by barony to pass it over as
obsolete, or this arose from negligence alone, it cannot be doubted that
the proviso preserving the right of sitting in parliament by a feudal
honour was introduced in order to save that privilege, as well for Arundel
and Abergavenny as for any other that might be entitled to
it.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N10" id="N10"></a>Note</span> X. Page 142.</p>

<p>The equitable jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery has been lately
traced, in some respects, though not for the special purpose mentioned in
the text, higher than the reign of Richard II. This great minister of the
crown, as he was at least from the time of the
Conquest,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
always till the reign of Edward III. an ecclesiastic of high dignity, and honourably
distinguished as the keeper of the king's conscience, was peculiarly
intrusted with the duty of redressing the grievances of the subject, both
when they sprung from misconduct of the government, through its
subordinate officers, and when the injury had been inflicted by powerful
oppressors. He seems generally to have been the chief or president of the
council, when it exerted that jurisdiction which we have been sketching in
the text, and which will be the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> of another note. But he is more
prominent when presiding in a separate tribunal as a single judge.</p>

<p>The Court of Chancery is not distinctly to be traced under Henry III. For
a passage in Matthew Paris, who says of Radulfus de Nevil&mdash;"Erat regis
fidelissimus cancellarius, et inconcussa columna veritatis, singulis sua
jura, pr√¶cipue pauperibus, just√® reddens et indilat√®," may be construed of
his judicial conduct in the council. This province naturally, however, led
to a separation of the two powers. And in the reign of Edward I. we find
the king sending certain of the petitions addressed to him, praying
extraordinary remedies, to the chancellor and master of the rolls, or to
either separately, by writ under the privy seal, which was the usual mode
by which the king delegated the exercise of his prerogative to his
council, directing them to give such remedy as should appear to be
consonant to honesty (or equity, <i>honestati</i>). "There is reason to
believe," says Mr. Spence (Equitable Jurisdiction, p. 335), "that this was
not a novelty." But I do not know upon what grounds this is believed.
Writs, both those of course and others, issued from Chancery in the same
reign. (Palgrave's Essay on King's Council, p. 15.) Lord Campbell has
given a few specimens of petitions to the council, and answers endorsed
upon them, in the reign of Edward I., communicated to him by Mr. Hardy
from the records of the Tower. In all these the petitions are referred to
the chancellor for justice. The entry, at least as given by lord Campbell,
is commonly so short that we cannot always determine whether the petition
was on account of wrongs by the crown or others. The following is rather
more clear than the rest:&mdash;"18 Edw. I. The king's tenants of Aulton
complain that Adam Gordon ejected them from their pasture, contrary to the
tenor of the king's writ. Resp. Veniant partes coram cancellario, et
ostendat ei Adam quare ipsos ejecit, et fiat iis justitia." Another is a
petition concerning concealment of dower, for which, perhaps, there was no
legal remedy.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward II. the peculiar jurisdiction of the chancellor was
still more distinctly marked. "From petitions and answers lately
discovered, it appears that during this reign the jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery was considerably extended, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> 'consuetudo
cancellari√¶' is often familiarly mentioned. We find petitions referred to
the chancellor in his court, either separately, or in conjunction with the
king's justices, or the king's serjeants; on disputes respecting the
wardship of infants, partition, dower, rent-charges, tithes, and goods of
felons. The chancellor was in full possession of his jurisdiction over
charities, and he superintended the conduct of coroners. Mere wrongs, such
as malicious prosecutions and trespasses to personal property, are
sometimes the subject of proceedings before him; but I apprehend that
those were cases where, from powerful combinations and confederacies,
redress could not be obtained in the courts of common law." (Lives of
Chanc. vol. i. p. 204.)</p>

<p>Lord Campbell, still with materials furnished by Mr. Hardy, has given not
less than thirty-eight entries during the reign of Edward II., where the
petition, though sometimes directed to the council, is referred to the
chancellor for determination. One only of these, so far as we can judge
from their very brief expression, implies anything of an equitable
jurisdiction. It is again a case of dower, and the claimant is remitted to
the Chancery; "et fiat sibi ibidem justitia, quia non potest juvari per
communem legem per breve de dote." This case is in the Rolls of Parliament
(i. 340), and had been previously mentioned by Mr. Bruce in a learned
memoir on the Court of Star-Chamber. (Arch√¶ologia, xxv. 345.) It is
difficult to say whether this fell within the modern rules of equity, but
the general principle is evidently the same.</p>

<p>Another petition is from the commonalty of Suffolk to the council,
complaining of false indictments and presentments in courts-leet. It is
answered&mdash;"Si quis sequi voluerit adversus falsos indicatores et
procuratores de falsis indictamentis, sequatur in Cancell. et habebit
remedium consequens." Several other entries in this list are illustrative
of the jurisdiction appertaining, in fact at least, to the council and the
chancellor; and being of so early a reign form a valuable accession to
those which later records have furnished to Sir Matthew Hale and others.</p>

<p>The Court of Chancery began to decide causes as a court of equity,
according to Mr. Hardy, in the reign of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> Edward III., probably about 22
Edw. III. (Introduction to Close Rolls, p. 28.) Lord Campbell would carry
this jurisdiction higher, and the instances already mentioned may be
sufficient just to prove that it had begun to exist. It certainly seems no
unnatural supposition that the great principle of doing justice, by which
the council and the chancellor professed to guide their exercise of
judicature, may have led them to grant relief in some of those numerous
instances where the common law was defective or its rules too technical
and unbending. But, as has been observed, the actual entries, as far as
quoted, do not afford many precedents of equity. Mr. Hardy, indeed,
suggests (p. 25) that the <i>Curia Regis</i> in the Norman period proceeded on
equitable principles; and that this led to the removal of plaints into it
from the county-court. This is, perhaps, not what we should naturally
presume. The subtle and technical spirit of the Norman lawyers is
precisely that which leads, in legal procedure, to definite and unbending
rules; while in the lower courts, where Anglo-Saxon thanes had ever judged
by the broad rules of justice, according to the circumstances of the case,
rather than a strict line of law which did not yet exist, we might expect
to find all the uncertainty and inconsistency which belongs to a system of
equity, until, as in England, it has acquired by length of time the
uniformity of law, but none at least of the technicality so characteristic
of our Norman common law, and by which the great object of judicial
proceedings was so continually defeated. This, therefore, does not seem to
me a probable cause of the removal of suits from the county-court or
court-baron to those of Westminster. The true reason, as I have observed
in another place, was the partiality of these local tribunals. And the
expense of trying a suit before the justices in eyre might not be very
much greater than in the county-court.</p>

<p>I conceive, therefore, that the three supreme courts at Westminster
proceeded upon those rules of strict law which they had chiefly themselves
established; and this from the date of their separation from the original
<i>Curia Regis</i>. But whether the king's council may have given more
extensive remedies than the common law afforded, as early at least as the
reign of Henry III., is what we are not competent, apparently, to affirm
or deny. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
are at present only concerned with the Court of Chancery. And
it will be interesting to quote the deliberate opinion of a late
distinguished writer, who has taken a different view of the subject from
any of his predecessors.</p>

<p>"After much deliberation," says Lord Campbell, "I must express my clear
conviction that the chancellor's equitable jurisdiction is as indubitable
and as ancient as his common-law jurisdiction, and that it may be traced
in a manner equally satisfactory. The silence of Bracton, Glanvil, Fleta,
and other early juridical writers, has been strongly relied upon to
disprove the equitable jurisdiction of the chancellor; but they as little
notice his common-law jurisdiction, most of them writing during the
subsistence of the <i>Aula Regia</i>; and they all speak of the Chancery, not
as a court, but merely as an office for the making and sealing of writs.
There are no very early decisions of the chancellors on points of law any
more than of equity, to be found in the Year-books or old abridgments....
By 'equitable jurisdiction' must be understood the extraordinary
interference of the chancellor, without common-law process or regard to
the common-law rules of proceeding, upon the petition of a party grieved
who was without adequate remedy in a court of common law; whereupon the
opposite party was compelled to appear and to be examined, either
personally or upon written interrogatories: and evidence being heard on
both sides, without the interposition of a jury, an order was made
<i>secundum √¶quum et bonum</i>, which was enforced by imprisonment. Such a
jurisdiction had belonged to the Aula Regia, and was long exercised by
parliament; and, when parliament was not sitting, by the king's ordinary
council. Upon the dissolution of the <i>Aula Regia</i> many petitions, which
parliament or the council could not conveniently dispose of, were referred
to the chancellor, sometimes with and sometimes without assessors. To
avoid the circuity of applying to parliament or the council, the petition
was very soon, in many instances, addressed originally to the chancellor
himself." (Lives of Chancellors, i. 7.)</p>

<p>In the latter part of Edward III.'s long reign this equitable jurisdiction
had become, it is likely, of such frequent exercise, that we may consider
the following brief summary by Lord Campbell as probable by analogy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> and
substantially true, if not sustained in all respects by the evidence that
has yet been brought to light:&mdash;"The jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
was now established in all matters where its own officers were concerned,
in petitions of right where an injury was alleged to be done to a subject
by the king or his officers in relieving against judgments in courts of
law (lord C. gives two instances), and generally in cases of fraud,
accident, and trust." (p. 291.)</p>

<p>In the reign of Richard II. the writ of <i>subp&oelig;na</i> was invented by John
de Waltham, master of the rolls; and to this a great importance seems to
have been attached at the time, as we may perceive by the frequent
complaints of the commons in parliament, and by the traditionary
abhorrence in which the name of the inventor was held. "In reality," says
lord Campbell, "he first framed it in its present form when a clerk in
Chancery in the latter end of the reign of Edward III.; but the invention
consisted in merely adding to the old clause, <i>Quibusdam certis de causis,
the words 'Et hoc sub p&oelig;na centum librarum nullatenus omittas</i>;' and I
am at a loss to conceive how such importance was attached to it, or how it
was supposed to have brought about so complete a revolution in equitable
proceedings, for the penalty was never enforced; and if the party failed
to appear, his default was treated, according to the practice prevailing
in our own time, as a contempt of court, and made the foundation of
compulsory process." (p. 296.)</p>

<p>The commons in parliament, whose sensitiveness to public grievances was by
no means accompanied by an equal sagacity in devising remedies, had,
probably without intention, vastly enhanced the power of the chancellor by
a clause in a remedial act passed in the thirty-sixth year of Edward III.,
that, "If any man that feeleth himself aggrieved contrary to any of the
articles above written, or others contained in divers statutes, will come
into the Chancery, or any for him, and thereof make his complaint, he
shall presently there have remedy by force of the said articles or
statutes, without elsewhere pursuing to have remedy." Yet nothing could be
more obvious than that the breach of any statute was cognizable before the
courts of law. And the mischief of permitting men to be sued vexatiously
before the chancellor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
becoming felt, a statute was enacted, thirty years
indeed after this time (17 Ric. II. c. 6), analogous altogether to those
in the late reign respecting the jurisdiction of the council, which,
reciting that "people be compelled to come before the king's council, or
in the Chancery, by writs grounded on untrue suggestions," provides that
"the chancellor for the time being, presently after that such suggestions
be duly found and proved untrue, shall have power to ordain and award
damages, according to his discretion, to him which is so troubled unduly
as aforesaid." "This remedy," lord Campbell justly remarks, "which was
referred to the discretion of the chancellor himself, whose jurisdiction
was to be controlled, proved, as might be expected, wholly ineffectual;
but it was used as a parliamentary recognition of his jurisdiction, and a
pretence for refusing to establish any other check on it." (p. 247.)</p>

<p>A few years before this statute the commons had petitioned (13 Ric. II.,
Rot. Parl. iii. 269) that the chancellor might make no order against the
common law, and that no one should appear before the chancellor where
remedy was given by the common law. "This carries with it an admission,"
as lord C. observes, "that a power of jurisdiction did reside in the
chancellor, so long as he did not determine against the common law, nor
interfere where the common law furnished a remedy. The king's answer,
'that it should continue as the usage had been heretofore,' clearly
demonstrates that such an authority, restrained within due bounds, was
recognised by the constitution of the country." (p. 305.)</p>

<p>The act of 17 Ric. II. seems to have produced a greater regularity in the
proceedings of the court, and put an end to such hasty interference, on
perhaps verbal suggestions, as had given rise to this remedial provision.
From the very year in which the statute was enacted we find bills in
Chancery, and the answers to them, regularly filed; the grounds of
demanding relief appear, and the chancellor renders himself in every
instance responsible for the orders he has issued, by thus showing that
they came within his jurisdiction. There are certainly many among the
earlier bills in Chancery, which, according to the statute law and the
great principle that they were determinable in other courts, could not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
been heard; but we are unable to pronounce how far the allegation
usually contained or implied, that justice could not be had elsewhere, was
founded on the real circumstances. A calendar of these early proceedings
(in abstract) is printed in the Introduction to the first volume of the
Calendar of Chancery Proceedings in the Reign of Elizabeth, and may also
be found in Cooper's Public Records, i. 356.</p>

<p>The struggle, however, in behalf of the common law was not at an end. It
is more than probable that the petitions against encroachments of
Chancery, which fill the rolls under Henry IV., Henry V., and in the
minority of Henry VI., emanated from that numerous and jealous body whose
interests as well as prejudices were so deeply affected. Certain it is
that the commons, though now acknowledging an equitable jurisdiction, or
rather one more extensive than is understood by the word "equitable," in
the greatest judicial officer of the crown, did not cease to remonstrate
against his transgression of these boundaries. They succeeded so far, in
1436, as to obtain a statute (15 Hen. VI. c. 4) in these words:&mdash;"For that
divers persons have before this time been greatly vexed and grieved by
writs of <i>subp&oelig;na</i>, purchased for matters determinable by the common
law of this land, to the great damage of such persons so vexed, in
suspension and impediment of the common law as aforesaid; Our lord the
king doth command that the statutes thereof made shall be duly observed,
according to the form and effect of the same, and that no writ of
<i>subp&oelig;na</i> be granted from henceforth until surety be found to satisfy
the party so grieved and vexed for his damages and expenses, if so be that
the matter cannot be made good which is contained in the bill." It was the
intention of the commons, as appears by the preamble of this statute, and
more fully by their petition in Rot. Parl. (iv. 101), that the matters
contained in the bill on which the <i>subp&oelig;na</i> was issued should be not
only true in themselves, but such as could not be determined at common
law. But the king's answer appears rather equivocal.</p>

<p>The principle seems nevertheless to have been generally established, about
the reign of Henry VI., that the Court of Chancery exercises merely a
remedial jurisdiction, not indeed controllable by courts of law, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
possibly in such circumstances as cannot be expected, but bound by its
general responsibility to preserve the limits which ancient usage and
innumerable precedents have imposed. It was at the end of this reign, and
not in that of Richard II., according to the writer so often quoted, that
the great enhancement of the chancellor's authority, by bringing
feoffments to uses within it, opened a new era in the history of our law.
And this the judges brought on themselves by their narrow adherence to
technical notions. They now began to discover this; and those of Edward
IV., as lord Campbell well says, were "very bold men," having repealed the
statute <i>de donis</i> by their own authority in Taltarum's case&mdash;a stretch of
judicial power beyond any that the Court of Chancery had ventured upon.
They were also exceedingly jealous of that court; and in one case,
reported in the Year-books (22 Edw. IV. 37), advised a party to disobey an
injunction from the Court of Chancery, telling him that, if the chancellor
committed him to the Fleet, they would discharge the prisoner by <i>habeas
corpus</i>. (Lord Campbell, p. 394.) The case seems to have been one where,
in modern times, no injunction would have been granted, the courts of law
being competent to apply a remedy.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N11" id="N11"></a>Note</span> XI. Page 145.</p>

<p>This intricate subject has been illustrated, since the first publication
of these volumes, in an Essay upon the original Authority of the King's
Council, by Sir Francis Palgrave (1834), written with remarkable
perspicuity and freedom from diffusiveness. But I do not yet assent to the
judgment of the author as to the legality of proceedings before the
council, which I have represented as unconstitutional, and which certainly
it was the object of parliament to restrain.</p>

<p>"It seems," he says, "that in the reign of Henry III. the council was
considered as a court of peers within the terms of Magna Charta; and
before which, as a court of original jurisdiction, the rights of tenants
holding <i>in capite</i> or by barony were to be discussed and decided, and it
unquestionably exercised a direct jurisdiction over all the king's
subjects" (p. 34). The first volume of Close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> Rolls, published by Mr.
Hardy since Sir F. Palgrave's Essay, contains no instances of jurisdiction
exercised by the council in the reign of John. But they begin immediately
afterwards, in the minority of Henry III.; so that we have not only the
fullest evidence that the council took on itself a coercive jurisdiction
in matters of law at that time, but that it had not done so before: for
the Close Rolls of John are so full as to render the negative argument
satisfactory. It will, of course, be understood that I take the facts on
the authority of Mr. Hardy (Introduction to Close Rolls, vol. ii.), whose
diligence and accuracy are indisputable. Thus this exercise of judicial
power began immediately after the Great Charter. And yet, if it is to be
reconciled with the twenty-ninth section, it is difficult to perceive in
what manner that celebrated provision for personal liberty against the
crown, which has always been accounted the most precious jewel in the
whole coronet, the most valuable stipulation made at Runnymede, and the
most enduring to later times, could merit the fondness with which it has
been regarded. "Non super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per
legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terr√¶." If it is alleged that
the jurisdiction of the king's council was the law of the land, the whole
security falls to the ground and leaves the grievance as it stood,
unredressed. Could the judgment of the council have been reckoned, as Sir
P. Palgrave supposes, a "judicium parium suorum," except perhaps in the
case of tenants in chief? The word is commonly understood of that trial
<i>per pais</i> which, in one form or another, is of immemorial antiquity in
our social institutions.</p>

<p>"Though this jurisdiction," he proceeds, "was more frequently called into
action when parliament was sitting, still it was no less inherent in the
council at all other times; and until the middle of the reign of Edward
III. no exception had ever been taken to the form of its proceedings." He
subjoins indeed in a note, "Unless the statute of 5 Edw. III. c. 9, may be
considered as an earlier testimony against the authority of the council.
This, however, is by no means clear, and there is no corresponding
petition in the parliament roll from which any further information could
be obtained" (p. 34).</p>

<p>The irresistible conclusion from this passage is, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> we have been
wholly mistaken in supposing the commons under Edward III. and his
successors to have resisted an illegal encroachment of power in the king's
ordinary council, while it had in truth been exercising an ancient
jurisdiction, never restrained by law and never complained of by the
subject. This would reverse our constitutional theory to no small degree,
and affect so much the spirit of my own pages, that I cannot suffer it to
pass, coming on an authority so respectable, without some comment. But why
is it asserted that this jurisdiction was inherent in the council? Why are
we to interpret Magna Charta otherwise than according to the natural
meaning of the words and the concurrent voice of parliament? The silence
of the commons in parliament under Edward II. as to this grievance will
hardly prove that it was not felt, when we consider how few petitions of a
public nature, during that reign, are on the rolls. But it may be admitted
that they were not so strenuous in demanding redress, because they were of
comparatively recent origin as an estate of parliament, as they became in
the next long reign, the most important, perhaps, in our early
constitutional history.</p>

<p>It is doubted by Sir F. Palgrave whether the statute of 5 Edw. III. c. 9,
can be considered as a testimony against the authority of the council. It
is, however, very natural so to interpret it, when we look at the
subsequent statutes and petitions of the commons, directed for more than a
century to the same object. "No man shall be taken," says lord Coke (2
Inst. 46), "that is, restrained of liberty, by petition or suggestion to
the king or to his council, unless it be by indictment or presentment of
good and lawful men, where such deeds be done. This branch and divers
other parts of this act have been wholly explained by divers acts of
parliament, &amp;c., quoted in the margent." He then gives the titles of six
statutes, the first being this of 5 Edw. III. c. 9. But let us suppose
that the petition of the commons in 25 Edw. III. demanded an innovation in
law, as it certainly did in long-established usage. And let us admit what
is justly pointed out by Sir F. Palgrave, that the king's first answer to
their petition is not commensurate to its request, and reserves, though it
is not quite easy to see what, some part of its extraordinary
jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Still the statute itself, enacted on a similar
petition in a subsequent parliament, is explicit that "none shall be taken
by petition or suggestion to the king or his council, unless it be by
indictment or presentment" (in a criminal charge), "or by writ original at
the common law" (in a civil suit), "nor shall be put out of his franchise
of freehold, unless he have been duly put to answer, and forejudged of the
same by due course of law."</p>

<p>Lord Hale has quoted a remarkable passage from a Year-book, not long after
these statutes of 25 Edw. III. and 28 Edw. III., which, if Sir F. Palgrave
had not overlooked, he would have found not very favourable to his high
notions of the king's prerogative in council. "In after ages," says Hale,
"the constant opinion and practice was to disallow any reversals of
judgment by the council, which appears by the notable case in Year-book,
39 Edw. III. 14." (Jurisdiction of Lords' House, p. 41.) It is indeed a
notable case, wherein the chancellor before the council reverses a
judgment of a court of law. "Mes les justices ne pristoient nul regard al
reverser devant le council, par ceo que ce ne fust place ou jugement
purroit estre reverse." If the council could not exercise this
jurisdiction on appeal, which is not perhaps expressly taken away by any
statute, much less against the language of so many statutes could they
lawfully entertain any original suit. Such, however, were the vacillations
of a motley assembly, so steady the perseverance of government in
retaining its power, so indefinite the limits of ancient usage, so loose
the phrases of remedial statutes, passing sometimes by their generality
the intentions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
those who enacted them, so useful, we may add, and
almost indispensable, was a portion of those prerogatives which the crown
exercised through the council and chancery, that we find soon afterwards a
statute (37 Edw. III. c. 18), which recognises in some measure those
irregular proceedings before the council, by providing only that those who
make suggestions to the chancellor and great council, by which men are put
in danger against the form of the charter, shall give security for proving
them. This is rendered more remedial by another act next year (38 Edw.
III. c. 9), which, however, leaves the liberty of making such suggestions
untouched. The truth is, that the act of 25 Edw. III. went to annihilate
the legal and equitable jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery&mdash;the former
of which had been long exercised, and the latter was beginning to spring
up. But the 42 Edw. III. c. 3, which seems to go as far as the former in
the enacting words, will be found, according to the preamble, to regard
only criminal charges.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Palgrave maintains that the council never intermitted its
authority, but on the contrary "it continually assumed more consistency
and order. It is probable that the long absences of Henry V. from England
invested this body with a greater degree of importance. After every
minority and after every appointment of a select or extraordinary council
by authority of the legislature, we find that the ordinary council
acquired a fresh impulse and further powers. Hence the next reign
constitutes a new era" (p. 80). He proceeds to give the same passage which
I have quoted from Rot. Parl. 8 Hen. VI., vol. v. p. 343, as well as one
in an earlier parliament (2 Hen. VI. p. 28). But I had neglected to state
the whole case where I mention the articles settled in parliament for the
regulation of the council. In the first place, this was not the king's
ordinary council, but one specially appointed by the lords in parliament
for the government of the realm during his minority. They consisted of
certain lords spiritual and temporal, the chancellor, the treasurer, and a
few commoners. These commissioners delivered a schedule of provisions "for
the good and the governance of the land, which the lords that be of the
king's council desireth" (p. 28). It does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
not explicitly appear that the
commons assented to these provisions; but it may be presumed, at least in
a legal sense, by their being present and by the schedule being delivered
into parliament, "baillez en meme le parlement." But in the 8 Hen. VI.,
where the same provision as to the jurisdiction of this extraordinary
council is repeated, the articles are said, after being approved by the
lords spiritual and temporal, to have been read "coram domino rege in
eodem parliamento, in presentia trium regni statuum" (p. 343). It is
always held that what is expressly declared to be done in presence of all
the estates is an act of parliament.</p>

<p>We find, therefore, a recognition of the principle which had always been
alleged in defence of the ordinary council in this parliamentary
confirmation&mdash;the principle that breaches of the law, which the law could
not, through the weakness of its ministers, or corruption, or partiality,
sufficiently repress, must be reserved for the strong arm of royal
authority. "Thus," says Sir Francis Palgrave, "did the council settle and
define its principles and practice. A new tribunal was erected, and one
which obtained a virtual supremacy over the common law. The exception
reserved to their 'discretion' of interfering wherever their lordships
felt too much might on one side, and too much unmight on the other, was of
itself sufficient to embrace almost every dispute or trial" (p. 81).</p>

<p>But, in the first place, this latitude of construction was not by any
means what the parliament meant to allow, nor could it be taken, except by
wilfully usurping powers never imparted; and, secondly, it was not the
ordinary council which was thus constituted during the king's minority;
nor did the jurisdiction intrusted to persons so specially named in
parliament extend to the regular officers of the crown. The restraining
statutes were suspended for a time in favour of a new tribunal. But I have
already observed that there was always a class of cases precisely of the
same kind as those mentioned in the act creating this tribunal, tacitly
excluded from the operation of those statutes, wherein the coercive
jurisdiction of the king's ordinary council had great convenience, namely,
where the course of justice was obstructed by riots, combinations of
maintenance, or overawing influence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
And there is no doubt that, down to
the final abolition of the Court of Star Chamber (which was no other than
the <i>consilium ordinarium</i> under a different name), these offences were
cognizable in it, without the regular forms of the common
law.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<p>"From the reign of Edward IV. we do not trace any further opposition to
the authority either of the chancery or of the council. These courts had
become engrafted on the constitution; and if they excited fear or
jealousy, there was no one who dared to complain. Yet additional
parliamentary sanction was not considered as unnecessary by Henry VII.,
and in the third year of his reign an act was passed for giving the Court
of Star Chamber, which had now acquired its determinate name, further
authority to punish divers misdemeanours." (Palgrave, p. 97.)</p>

<p>It is really more than we can grant that the jurisdiction of the
<i>consilium ordinarium</i> had been engrafted on the constitution, when the
statute-book was full of laws to restrain, if not to abrogate it. The acts
already mentioned, in the reign of Henry VI., by granting a temporary and
limited jurisdiction to the council, demonstrate that its general exercise
was not acknowledged by parliament. We can only say that it may have
continued without remonstrance in the reign of Edward IV. I have observed
in the text that the Rolls of Parliament under Edward IV. contain no
complaints of grievances. But it is not quite manifest that the council
did exercise in that reign as much jurisdiction as it had once done. Lord
Hale tells us that "this jurisdiction was gradually brought into great
disuse, though there remain some straggling footsteps of their proceedings
till near 3 Hen. VII." (Hist. of Lords' Jurisdiction, p. 38.) And the
famous statute in that year, which erected a new court, sometimes
improperly called the Court of Star Chamber, seems to have been prompted
by a desire to restore, in a new and more legal form, a jurisdiction which
was become almost obsolete, and, being in contradiction to acts of
parliament, could not well be rendered effective without
one.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<p>We cannot but discover, throughout the learned and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
luminous Essay on the Authority of the King's Council, a strong tendency to represent its
exercise as both constitutional and salutary. The former epithet cannot, I
think, be possibly applicable in the face of statute law; for what else
determines our constitution? But it is a problem with some, whether the
powers actually exerted by this anomalous court, admitting them to have
been, at least latterly, in contravention of many statutes, may not have
been rendered necessary by the disorderly condition of society and the
comparative impotence of the common law. This cannot easily be solved with
the defective knowledge that we possess. Sometimes, no doubt, the "might
on one side, and unmight on the other," as the answer to a petition
forcibly expresses it, afforded a justification which, practically at
least, the commons themselves were content to allow. But were these
exceptional instances so frequent as not to leave a much greater number
wherein the legal remedy by suit before the king's justices of assise
might have been perfectly effectual? For we are not concerned with the old
county-courts, which were perhaps tumultuary and partial enough, but with
the regular administration, civil and criminal, before the king's justices
of oyer and terminer and of gaol delivery. Had not they, generally
speaking, in the reign of Edward III. and his successors, such means of
enforcing the execution of law as left no sufficient pretext for recurring
to an arbitrary tribunal? Liberty, we should remember, may require the
sacrifice of some degree of security against private wrong, which a
despotic government, with an unlimited power of restraint, can alone
supply. If no one were permitted to travel on the high road without a
licence, or, as now so usual, without a passport, if no one could keep
arms without a registry, if every one might be indefinitely detained on
suspicion, the evil doers of society would be materially impeded, but at
the expense, to a certain degree, of every man's freedom and enjoyment.
Freedom being but a means to the greatest good, times might arise when it
must yield to the security of still higher blessings; but the immediate
question is, whether such were the state of society in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. Now, that it was lawless and insecure, comparatively
with our own times or the times of our fathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> is hardly to be disputed.
But if it required that arbitrary government which the king's council were
anxious to maintain, the representatives of the commons in parliament,
knights and burgesses, not above the law, and much interested in the
conservation of property, must have complained very unreasonably for more
than a hundred years. They were apparently as well able to judge as our
writers can be; and if they reckoned a trial by jury at <i>nisi prius</i> more
likely, on the whole, to insure a just adjudication of a civil suit, than
one before the great officers of state and other constituent members of
the ordinary council, it does not seem clear to me that we have a right to
assert the contrary. This mode of trial by jury, as has been seen in
another place, had acquired, by the beginning of the fifteenth century,
its present form; and considering the great authority of the judges of
assise, it may not, probably, have given very frequent occasion for
complaint of partiality or corrupt influence.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N12" id="N12"></a>Note</span> XII. Page 156.</p>

<p>The learned author of the Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal
Prerogative in England has founded his historical theory on the confusion
which he supposes to have grown up between the ideal king of the
constitution and the personal king on the throne. By the former he means
the personification of abstract principles, sovereign power, and absolute
justice, which the law attributes to the <i>genus</i> king, but which flattery
or other motives have transferred to the possessor of the crown for the
time being, and have thus changed the Teutonic <i>cyning</i>, the first man of
the commonwealth, the man of the highest weregild, the man who was so much
responsible that he might be sued for damages in his own courts or deposed
for misgovernment, into the sole irresponsible person of indefeasible
prerogatives, of attributes almost divine, whom Bracton and a long series
of subsequent lawyers raised up to a height far beyond the theory of our
early constitution.</p>

<p>This is supported with great acuteness and learning; nor is it possible to
deny that the king of England, as the law-books represent him, is
considerably different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
from what we generally conceive an ancient German
chieftain to have been. Yet I doubt whether Mr. Allen has not laid too
much stress on this, and given to the fictions of law a greater influence
than they possessed in those times to which his inquiry relates; and
whether, also, what he calls the monarchical theory was so much derived
from foreign sources as he apprehends. We have no occasion to seek, in the
systems of civilians or the dogmas of churchmen, what arose from a
deep-seated principle of human nature. A king is a person; to persons
alone we attach the attributes of power and wisdom; on persons we bestow
our affection or our ill-will. An abstraction, a politic idea of royalty,
is convenient for lawyers; it suits the speculative reasoner, but it never
can become so familiar to a people, especially one too rude to have
listened to such reasoners, as the simple image of the king, the one man
whom we are to love and to fear. The other idea is a sort of monarchical
pantheism, of which the vanishing point is a republic. And to this the
prevalent theory, that kings are to reign but not to govern, cannot but
lead. It is a plausible, and in the main, perhaps, for the times we have
reached, a necessary theory; but it renders monarchy ultimately scarcely
possible. And it was neither the sentiment of the Anglo-Saxons, nor of the
Norman baronage; the feudal relation was essentially and exclusively
personal; and if we had not enough, in a more universal feeling of human
nature, to account for loyalty, we could not mistake its inevitable
connexion with the fealty and homage of the vassal. The influence of Roman
notions was not inconsiderable upon the continent; but they never
prevailed very much here; and though, after the close alliance between the
church and state established by the Reformation, the whole weight of the
former was thrown into the scale of the crown, the medi√¶val clergy, as I
have observed in the text, were anything rather than upholders of despotic
power.</p>

<p>It may be very true that, by considering the monarchy as a merely
political institution, the scheme of prudent men to avoid confusion, and
confer the <i>minimum</i> of personal authority on the reigning prince, the
principle of his irresponsibility seems to be better maintained. But the
question to which we are turning our eyes is not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> political one; it
relates to the positive law and positive sentiments of the English nation
in the medi√¶val period. And here I cannot put a few necessary fictions
grown up in the courts, such as, the king never dies, the king can do no
wrong, the king is everywhere, against the tenor of our constitutional
language, which implies an actual and active personality. Mr. Allen
acknowledges that the act against the Despensers under Edward II., and
re-confirmed after its repeal, for promulgating the doctrine that
allegiance had more regard to the crown than to the person of the king,
"seems to establish, as the deliberate opinion of the legislature, that
allegiance is due to the person of the king generally, and not merely to
his crown or politic capacity, so as to be released and destroyed by his
misgovernment of the kingdom" (p. 14); which, he adds, is not easily
reconcilable with the deposition of Richard II. But that was accomplished
by force, with whatever formalities it may have been thought expedient to
surround it.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, infer from the declaration of the legislature, that
allegiance is due to the king's person and not to his politic capacity,
any such consequence as that it is not, in any possible case, to be
released by his misgovernment. This was surely not in the spirit of any
parliament under Edward II. or Edward III.; and it is precisely because
allegiance is due to the person, that, upon either feudal or natural
principles, it might be cancelled by personal misconduct. A contrary
language was undoubtedly held under the Stuarts; but it was not that of
the medi√¶val period.</p>

<p>The tenet of our law, that all the soil belongs theoretically to the king,
is undoubtedly an enormous fiction, and very repugnant to the barbaric
theory preserved by the Saxons, that all unappropriated land belonged to
the folk, and was unalienable without its
consent.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
It was, however, but an extension of the feudal tenure to the whole kingdom, and rested on
the personality of feudal homage. William established it more by his power
than by any theory of lawyers; though doubtless his successors often found
lawyers as ready to shape the acts of power into a theory as if they had
originally projected them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
And thus grew up the high schemes of
prerogative, which, for many centuries, were in conflict with those of
liberty. We are not able, nevertheless, to define the constitutional
authority of the Saxon kings; it was not legislative, nor was that of
William and his successors ever such; it was not exclusive of redress for
private wrong, nor was this ever the theory of English law, though the
method of remedy might not be sufficiently effective; yet it had certainly
grown before the Conquest, with no help from Roman notions, to something
very unlike that of the German kings in Tacitus.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N13" id="N13"></a>Note</span> XIII. Page 172.</p>

<p>The reduction of the free ceorls into villenage, especially if as general
as is usually assumed, is one of the most remarkable innovations during
the Anglo-Norman period; and one which, as far as our published records
extend, we cannot wholly explain. Observations have been made on it by Mr.
Wright, in the Arch√¶ologia (vol. xxx. p. 225). After adverting to the
oppression of the peasants in Normandy, which produced several rebellions,
he proceeds thus:&mdash;"These feelings of hatred and contempt for the
peasantry were brought into our island by the Norman barons in the latter
half of the eleventh century. The Saxon laws and customs continued; but
the Normans acted as the Franks had done towards the Roman coloni; they
enforced with harshness the laws which were in their own favour, and
gradually threw aside, or broke through, those which were in favour of the
miserable serf."</p>

<p>In the Laws of Henry I. we find the weregild of the twyhinder, or villein,
set at 200 shillings in Wessex, "qu√¶ caput regni est et legum" (c. 70).
But this expression argues an Anglo-Saxon source; and, in fact, so much in
that treatise seems to be copied, without regard to the change of times,
from old authorities, mixed up with provisions of a feudal or Norman
character, that we hardly know how to distinguish what belongs to each
period. It is far from improbable that villenage, in the sense the word
afterwards bore, that is, an absolutely servile tenure of lands, not only
without legal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
rights over them, but with an incapacity of acquiring
either immovable or movable property against the lord, may have made
considerable strides before the reign of Henry
II.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
But unless light
should be thrown on its history by the publication of more records, it
seems almost impossible to determine the introduction of predial villenage
more precisely than to say it does not appear in the laws of England at
the Conquest, and it does so in the time of Glanvil. Mr. Wright's Memoir
in the Arch√¶ologia, above quoted, contains some interesting matter; but he
has too much confounded the <i>theow</i>, or Anglo-Saxon slave, with the
<i>ceorl</i>; not even mentioning the latter, though it is indisputable that
<i>villanus</i> is the equivalent of <i>ceorl</i>, and <i>servus</i> of <i>theow</i>.</p>

<p>But I suspect that we go a great deal too far in setting down the
descendants of these ceorls, that is, the whole Anglo-Saxon population
except thanes and burgesses, as almost universally to be counted such
villeins as we read of in our law-books, or in concluding that the
cultivators of the land, even in the thirteenth century, were wholly, or
at least generally, servile. It is not only evident that small freeholders
were always numerous, but we are, perhaps, greatly deceived in fancying
that the occupiers of villein tenements were usually villeins.
<i>Terre-tenants en villenage</i> and tenants <i>par copie</i>, who were undoubtedly
free, appear in the early Year-books, and we know not why they may not
always have existed.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
This, however, is a subject which I am not
sufficiently conversant with records to explore; it deserves the attention
of those well-informed and diligent antiquaries whom we possess. Meantime
it is to be observed that the lands occupied by <i>villani</i> or <i>bordarii</i>,
according to the Domesday survey, were much more extensive than the
copyholds of the present day; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> making every allowance for
enfranchisements, we can hardly believe that all these lands, being, in
fact, by far the greater part of the soil, were the <i>villenagia</i> of
Glanvil's and Bracton's age. It would be interesting to ascertain at what
time the latter were distinguished from <i>libera tenementa</i>; at what time,
that is, the distinction of territorial servitude, independent as it was
of the personal state of the occupant, was established in England.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N14" id="N14"></a>Note</span> XIV. Page 173.</p>

<p>This identity of condition between the villein regardant and in gross
appears to have been, even lately, called in question, and some adhere to
the theory which supposes an inferiority in the latter. The following
considerations will prove that I have not been mistaken in rejecting it:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. It will not be contended that the words "regardant" and "in gross"
indicate of themselves any specific difference between the two, or can
mean anything but the title by which the villein was held; prescriptive
and territorial in one case, absolute in the other. For the proof,
therefore, of any such difference we require some ancient authority, which
has not been given. II. The villein regardant might be severed from the
manor, with or without land, and would then become a villein in gross. If
he was sold as a domestic serf, he might, perhaps, be practically in a
lower condition than before, but his legal state was the same. If he was
aliened with lands, parcel of the manor, as in the case of its descent to
coparceners who made partition, he would no longer be regardant, because
that implied a prescriptive dependence on the lord, but would occupy the
same tenements and be in exactly the same position as before. "Villein in
gross," says Littleton, "is where a man is seised of a manor whereunto a
villein is regardant, and granteth the same villein by deed to another;
then he is a villein in gross, and not regardant." (Sect. 181.) III. The
servitude of all villeins was so complete that we cannot conceive degrees
in it. No one could purchase lands or possess goods of his own; we do not
find that any one, being strictly a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> villein, held by certain services;
"he must have regard," says Coke, "to that which is commanded unto him;
or, in the words of Bracton, 'a quo pr√¶standum servitium incertum et
indeterminatum, ubi scire non poterit vespere quod servitium fieri debet
mane.'" (Co. Lit. 120, b.) How could a villein in gross be lower than
this? It is true that the villein had one inestimable advantage over the
American negro, that he was a freeman, except relatively to his lord;
possibly he might be better protected against personal injury; but in his
incapacity of acquiring secure property, or of refusing labour, he was
just on the same footing. It may be conjectured that some villeins in
gross were descended from the <i>servi</i>, of whom we find 25,000 enumerated
in Domesday. Littleton says, "If a man and his ancestors, whose heir he
is, have been seised of a villein and of his ancestors, as of villeins in
gross, time out of memory of man, these are villeins in gross." (Sect.
182.)</p>

<p>It has been often asserted that villeins in gross seem not to have been a
numerous class, and it might not be easy to adduce distinct instances of
them in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, though we should scarcely
infer, from the pains Littleton takes to describe them, that none were
left in his time. But some may be found in an earlier age. In the ninth of
John, William sued Ralph the priest for granting away lands which he held
to Canford priory. Ralph pleaded that they were his freehold. William
replied that he held them in villenage, and that he (the plaintiff) had
sold one of Ralph's sisters for four shillings. (Blomefield's Norfolk,
vol. iii. p. 860, 4to. edition.) And Mr. Wright has found in Madox's
Formulare Anglicanum not less than five instances of villeins sold with
their family and chattels, but without land. (Arch√¶ologia, xxx. 228.) Even
where they were sold along with land, unless it were a manor, they would,
as has been observed before, have been villeins in gross. I have, however,
been informed that in valuations under escheats in the old records a
separate value is never put upon villeins; their alienation without the
land was apparently not contemplated. Few cases concerning villeins in
gross, it has been said, occur in the Year-books; but villenage of any kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
does not furnish a great many; and in several I do not perceive, in
consulting the report, that the party can be shown to have been regardant.
One reason why villeins in gross should have become less and less numerous
was that they could, for the most part, only be claimed by showing a
written grant, or by prescription through descent; so that, if the
title-deed were lost, or the descent unproved, the villein became free.</p>

<p>Manumissions were often, no doubt, gratuitous; in some cases the villein
seems to have purchased his freedom. For though in strictness, as Glanvil
tells us, he could not "libertatem suam suis denariis qu√¶rere," inasmuch
as all he possessed already belonged to the lord, it would have been
thought a meanness to insist on so extreme a right. In order, however, to
make the deed more secure, it was usual to insert the name of a third
person as paying the consideration-money for the enfranchisement.
(Arch√¶ologia, xxx. 228.)</p>

<p>It appears not by any means improbable that regular money payments, or
other fixed liabilities, were often substituted instead of uncertain
services for the benefit of the lord as well as the tenant. And when these
had lasted a considerable time in any manor, the villenage of the latter,
without any manumission, would have expired by desuetude. But, perhaps, an
entry of his tenure on the court-roll, with a copy given to himself, would
operate of itself, in construction of law, as a manumission. This I do not
pretend to determine.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N15" id="N15"></a>Note</span> XV. Page 179.</p>

<p>The public history of Europe in the middle ages inadequately represents
the popular sentiment, or only when it is expressed too loudly to escape
the regard of writers intent sometimes on less important subjects. But
when we descend below the surface, a sullen murmur of discontent meets the
ear, and we perceive that mankind was not more insensible to wrongs and
sufferings than at present. Besides the various outbreakings of the people
in several counties, and their complaints in parliament, after the commons
obtained a representation, we gain a conclusive insight into the spirit of the times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
by their popular poetry. Two very interesting collections of
this kind have been lately published by the Camden Society, through the
diligence of Mr. Thomas Wright; one, the Poems attributed to Walter Mapes;
the other, the Political Songs of England, from John to Edward II.</p>

<p>Mapes lived under Henry II., and has long been known as the reputed author
of humorous Latin verses; but it seems much more probable, that the far
greater part of the collection lately printed is not from his hand. They
may pass, not for the production of a single person, but rather of a
class, during many years, or, in general words, a century, ending with the
death of Henry III. in 1272. Many of them are professedly written by an
imaginary Golias.</p>

<p>"They are not the expressions of hostility of one man against an order of
monks, but of the indignant patriotism of a considerable portion of the
English nation against the encroachments of civil and ecclesiastical
tyranny." (Introduction to Poems ascribed to Walter Mapes, p. 21.) The
poems in this collection reflect almost entirely on the pope and the
higher clergy. They are all in rhyming Latin, and chiefly, though with
exceptions, in the loose trochaic metre called Leonine. The authors,
therefore, must have been clerks, actuated by the spirit which, in a
church of great inequality in its endowments, and with a very numerous
body of poor clergy, is apt to gain strength, but certainly, as
ecclesiastical history bears witness, not one of mere envious malignity
towards the prelates and the court of Rome. These deserved nothing better,
in the thirteenth century, than biting satire and indignant reproof, and
the poets were willing enough to bestow both.</p>

<p>But this popular poetry of the middle ages did not confine itself to the
church. In the collection entitled 'Political Songs' we have some
reflecting on Henry III., some on the general administration. The famous
song on the battle of Lewes in 1264 is the earliest in English; but in the
reign of Edward I. several occur in that language. Others are in French or
in Latin; one complaining of the taxes is in an odd mixture of these two
languages; which, indeed, is not without other examples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> in medi√¶val
poetry. These Latin songs could not, of course, have been generally
understood. But what the priests sung in Latin, they said in English; the
lower clergy fanned the flame, and gave utterance to what others felt. It
may, perhaps, be remarked, as a proof of general sympathy with the
democratic spirit which was then fermenting, that we have a song of
exultation on the great defeat which Philip IV. had just sustained at
Courtrai, in 1302, by the burgesses of the Flemish cities, on whose
liberties he had attempted to trample (p. 187). It is true that Edward I.
was on ill terms with France, but the political interests of the king
would not, perhaps, have dictated the popular ballad.</p>

<p>It was an idle exaggeration in him who said that, if he could make the
ballads of a people, any one might make their laws. Ballads, like the
press, and especially that portion of the press which bears most analogy
to them, generally speaking, give vent to a spirit which has been at work
before. But they had, no doubt, an influence in rendering more
determinate, as well as more active, that resentment of wrong, that
indignation at triumphant oppression, that belief in the vices of the
great, which, too often for social peace and their own happiness, are
cherished by the poor. In comparison, indeed, with the efficacy of the
modern press, the power, of ballads is trifling. Their lively
sprightliness, the humorous tone of their satire, even their metrical
form, sheathe the sting; and it is only in times when political bitterness
is at its height that any considerable influence can be attached to them,
and then it becomes undistinguishable from more energetic motives. Those
which we read in the collection above mentioned appear to me rather the
signs of popular discontent than greatly calculated to enhance it. In that
sense they are very interesting, and we cannot but desire to see the
promised continuation to the end of Richard II.'s
reign.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> They are
said to have become afterwards less frequent, though the wars of the Roses
were likely to bring them, forward.</p>

<p>Some of the political songs are written in France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> though relating to our
kings John and Henry III. Deducting these, we have two in Latin for the
former reign; seven in Latin, three in French (or what the editor calls
Anglo-Norman, which is really the same thing), one in a mixture of the
two, and one in English, for the reign of Henry III. In the reigns of
Edward I. and Edward II. we have eight in Latin, three in French, nine in
English, and four in mixed languages; a style employed probably for
amusement. It must be observed that a large proportion of these songs
contain panegyric and exultation on victory rather than satire; and that
of the satire much is general, and much falls on the church; so that the
animadversions on the king and the nobility are not very frequent, though
with considerable boldness; but this is more shown in the Latin than the
English poems.</p>

strenuously maintained by the supposed compiler of these Reports, lord
Redesdale, on the claim to the barony of L'Isle in 1829. The ancestor had
been called by writ to several parliaments of Edw. III.; and having only a
daughter, the negative argument from the omission of his posterity is of
little value; for though the husbands of heiresses were frequently
summoned, this does not seem to have been an universal practice. It was
held by lord Redesdale, that, at least until the statute of 5 Richard II.
c. 4, no hereditary or even personal right to the peerage was created by
the writ of summons. The house of lords rejected the claim, though the
language of their resolution is not conclusive as to the principle. The
opinion of lord R. has been ably impugned by Sir Harris Nicolas, in his
Report of the L'Isle Peerage, 1829.</p></div>

by Sir Harris Nicolas, in some remarks on such a claim preferred by the
present earl Fitzharding while yet a commoner, in virtue of the possession
of Berkeley castle, published as an Appendix to his Report of the L'Isle
Peerage. In the particular case there seem to have been several
difficulties, independently of the great one, that, in the reign of
Charles II., barony by tenure had been finally condemned. But there is
surely a great general difficulty on the opposite side, in the hypothesis
that, while it is acknowledged that there were, in the reigns of Edward I.
and Edward II., certain known persons holding by barony and called peers
of the realm, it could have been agreeable to the feudal or to the English
constitution that the king, by refusing to the posterity of such barons a
writ of summons to parliament, might deprive them of their nobility, and
reduce them for ever to the rank of commoners.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_471_471" id="Footnote_471_471"></a><a href="#FNanchor_471_471"><span class="label">[n]</span></a> It has been doubted, notwithstanding the authority of
Spelman, and some earlier but rather precarious testimony, whether the
chancellor before the Conquest was any more than a scribe or secretary.
Palgrave, in the Quarterly Review, xxxiv. 291. The Anglo-Saxon charters,
as far as I have observed, never mention him as a witness; which seems a
very strong circumstance. Ingulfus, indeed, has given a pompous account of
chancellor Turketul; and, if the history ascribed to Ingulfus be genuine,
the office must have been of high dignity. Lord Campbell assumes this in
his Lives of the Chancellors.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_472_472" id="Footnote_472_472"></a><a href="#FNanchor_472_472"><span class="label">[o]</span></a> The words of the petition and answer are the following:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Item, que nul franc homme ne soit mys a respondre de son franc tenement,
ne de riens qui touche vie et membre, fyns ou redemptions, par apposailles
devant le conseil notre seigneur le roi, ne devant ses ministres
queconques, sinoun par proces de ley de ces en arere use."
</p><p>
"Il plest a notre seigneur le roi que les leies de son roialme soient

arere." Rot. Par. ii. 228.
</p><p>
It is not easy to perceive what was reserved by the words "chose que
touche vie ou membre;" for the council never determined these. Possibly it
regarded accusations of treason or felony, which they might entertain as
an inquest, though they would ultimately be tried by a jury. Contempts are
easily understood; and by excesses were meant riots and seditions. These
political offences, which could not be always safely tried in a lower
court, it was the constant intention of the government to reserve for the
council.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been the object of every preceding chapter of this work, either to
trace the civil revolutions of states during the period of the middle
ages, or to investigate, with rather more minute attention, their
political institutions. There remains a large tract to be explored, if we
would complete the circle of historical information, and give to our
knowledge that copiousness and clear perception which arise from
comprehending a subject under numerous relations. The philosophy of
history embraces far more than the wars and treaties, the factions and
cabals of common political narration; it extends to whatever illustrates
the character of the human species in a particular period, to their
reasonings and sentiments, their arts and industry. Nor is this
comprehensive survey merely interesting to the speculative philosopher;
without it the statesman would form very erroneous estimates of events,
and find himself constantly misled in any analogical application of them
to present circumstances. Nor is it an uncommon source
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> of error to
neglect the general signs of the times, and to deduce a prognostic from
some partial coincidence with past events, where a more enlarged
comparison of all the facts that ought to enter into the combination would
destroy the whole parallel. The philosophical student, however, will not
follow the antiquary into his minute details; and though it is hard to say
what may not supply matter for a reflecting mind, there is always some
danger of losing sight of grand objects in historical disquisition, by too
laborious a research into trifles. I may possibly be thought to furnish,
in some instances, an example of the error I condemn. But in the choice
and disposition of topics to which the present chapter relates, some have
been omitted oh account of their comparative insignificance, and others on
account of their want of connexion with the leading subject. Even of those
treated I can only undertake to give a transient view; and must bespeak
the reader's candour to remember that passages which, separately taken,
may often appear superficial, are but parts of the context of a single
chapter, as the chapter itself is of an entire work.</p>

<p>The Middle Ages, according to the division I have adopted, comprise about
one thousand years, from the invasion of France by Clovis to that of
Naples by Charles VIII. This period, considered as to the state of
society, has been esteemed dark through ignorance, and barbarous through
poverty and want of refinement. And although this character is much less
applicable to the last two centuries of the period than to those which
preceded its commencement, yet we cannot expect to feel, in respect of
ages at best imperfectly civilized and slowly progressive, that interest
which attends a more perfect development of human capacities, and more
brilliant advances in improvement. The first moiety indeed of these ten
ages is almost absolutely barren, and presents little but a catalogue of
evils. The subversion of the Roman empire, and devastation of its
provinces, by barbarous nations, either immediately preceded, or were
coincident with the commencement of the middle period. We begin in
darkness and calamity; and though the shadows grow fainter as we advance,
yet we are to break off our pursuit as the morning breathes upon us, and
the twilight reddens into the lustre of day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline of learning in Roman empire.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
No circumstance is so prominent on the first survey of society during the
earlier centuries of this period as the depth of ignorance in which it was
immersed; and as from this, more than any single cause, the moral and
social evils which those ages experienced appear to have been derived and
perpetuated, it deserves to occupy the first place in the arrangement of
our present subject. We must not altogether ascribe the ruin of literature
to the barbarian destroyers of the Roman empire. So gradual, and,
apparently, so irretrievable a decay had long before spread over all
liberal studies, that it is impossible to pronounce whether they would not
have been almost equally extinguished if the august throne of the C√¶sars
had been left to moulder by its intrinsic weakness. Under the paternal
sovereignty of Marcus Aurelius the approaching declension of learning
might be scarcely perceptible to an incurious observer. There was much
indeed to distinguish his times from those of Augustus; much lost in
originality of genius, in correctness of taste, in the masterly conception
and consummate finish of art, in purity of the Latin, and even of the
Greek language. But there were men who made the age famous, grave lawyers,
judicious historians, wise philosophers; the name of learning was
honourable, its professors were encouraged; and along the vast surface of
the Roman empire there was perhaps a greater number whose minds were
cultivated by intellectual discipline than under the more brilliant reign
of the first emperor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its causes.</div>

<p>It is not, I think, very easy to give a perfectly satisfactory solution of
the rapid downfall of literature between the ages of Antonine and of
Diocletian. Perhaps the prosperous condition of the empire from Trajan to
Marcus Aurelius, and the patron age which those good princes bestowed on
letters, gave an artificial health to them for a moment, and suspended the
operation of a disease which had already begun to undermine their vigour.
Perhaps the intellectual energies of mankind can never remain stationary;
and a nation that ceases to produce original and inventive minds, born to
advance the landmarks of knowledge or skill, will recede from step to
step, till it loses even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
secondary merits of imitation and industry.
During the third century, not only there were no great writers, but even
few names of indifferent writers have been recovered by the diligence of
modern inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
Law neglected, philosophy perverted till it became
contemptible, history nearly silent, the Latin tongue growing rapidly
barbarous, poetry rarely and feebly attempted, art more and more vitiated;
such were the symptoms by which the age previous to Constantine announced
the decline of human intellect. If we cannot fully account for this
unhappy change, as I have observed, we must, however, assign much weight
to the degradation of Rome and Italy in the system of Severus and his
successors, to the admission of barbarians into the military and even
civil dignities of the empire, to the discouraging influence of provincial
and illiterate sovereigns, and to the calamities which followed for half a
century the first invasion of the Goths and the defeat of Decius. To this
sickly condition of literature the fourth century supplied no permanent
remedy. If under the house of Constantine the Roman world suffered rather
less from civil warfare or barbarous invasions than in the preceding age,
yet every other cause of decline just enumerated prevailed with aggravated
force; and the fourth century set in storms, sufficiently destructive in
themselves, and ominous of those calamities which humbled the majesty of
Rome at the commencement of the ensuing period, and overwhelmed the
Western Empire in absolute and final ruin before its termination.</p>

<p>The diffusion of literature is perfectly distinguishable from its
advancement; and whatever obscurity we may find in explaining the
variations of the one, there are a few simple causes which seem to account
for the other. Knowledge will be spread over the surface of a nation in
proportion to the facilities of education; to the free circulation of
books; to the emoluments and distinctions which literary attainments are
found to produce; and still more to the reward which they meet in the
general respect and applause of society. This cheering incite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>ment, the
genial sunshine of approbation, has at all times promoted the cultivation
of literature in small republics rather than large empires, and in cities
compared with the country. If these are the sources which nourish
literature, we should naturally expect that they must have become scanty
or dry when learning languishes or expires. Accordingly, in the later ages
of the Roman empire a general indifference towards the cultivation of
letters became the characteristic of its inhabitants. Laws were indeed
enacted by Constantine, Julian, Theodosius, and other emperors, for the
encouragement of learned men and the promotion of liberal education. But
these laws, which would not perhaps have been thought necessary in better
times, were unavailing to counteract the lethargy of ignorance in which
even the native citizens of the empire were contented to repose. This
alienation of men from their national literature may doubtless be imputed
in some measure to its own demerits. A jargon of mystical philosophy, half
fanaticism and half imposture, a barren and inflated eloquence, a
frivolous philology, were not among those charms of wisdom by which man is
to be diverted from pleasure or aroused from indolence.</p>

<p>In this temper of the public mind there was little probability that new
compositions of excellence would be produced, and much doubt whether the
old would be preserved. Since the invention of printing, the absolute
extinction of any considerable work seems a danger too improbable for
apprehension. The press pours forth in a few days a thousand volumes,
which, scattered like seeds in the air over the republic of Europe, could
hardly be destroyed without the extirpation of its inhabitants. But in the
times of antiquity manuscripts were copied with cost, labour, and delay;
and if the diffusion of knowledge be measured by the multiplication of
books, no unfair standard, the most golden ages of ancient learning could
never bear the least comparison with the three last centuries. The
destruction of a few libraries by accidental fire, the desolation of a few
provinces by unsparing and illiterate barbarians, might annihilate every
vestige of an author, or leave a few scattered copies, which, from the
public indifference, there was no inducement to multiply, exposed to
similar casualties in succeeding times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
We are warranted by good authorities to assign, as a collateral cause of
this irretrievable revolution the neglect of heathen literature by the
Christian church. I am not versed enough in ecclesiastical writers to
estimate the degree of this neglect; nor am I disposed to deny that the
mischief was beyond recovery before the accession of Constantine. From the
primitive ages, however, it seems that a dislike of pagan learning was
pretty general among Christians. Many of the fathers undoubtedly were
accomplished in liberal studies, and we are indebted to them for valuable
fragments of authors whom we have lost. But the literary character of the
church is not to be measured by that of its more illustrious leaders.
Proscribed and persecuted, the early Christians had not perhaps access to
the public schools, nor inclination to studies which seemed, very
excusably, uncongenial to the character of their profession. Their
prejudices, however, survived the establishment of Christianity. The
fourth council of Carthage in 398 prohibited the reading of secular books
by bishops. Jerome plainly condemns the study of them except for pious
ends. All physical science especially was held in avowed contempt, as
inconsistent with revealed truths. Nor do there appear to have been any
canons made in favour of learning, or any restriction on the ordination of
persons absolutely
illiterate.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
There was indeed abundance of what is
called theological learning displayed in the controversies of the fourth
and fifth centuries; and those who admire such disputations may consider
the principal champions in them as contributing to the glory, or at least
retarding the decline, of literature. But I believe rather that polemical
disputes will be found not only to corrupt the genuine spirit of religion,
but to degrade and contract the faculties. What keenness and subtlety
these may sometimes acquire by such exercise is more like that worldly
shrewdness we see in men whose trade it is to outwit their neighbours than
the clear and calm discrimination of philosophy. However this may be, it
cannot be doubted that the controversies agitated in the church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> during
these two centuries must have diverted studious minds from profane
literature, and narrowed more and more the circle of that knowledge which
they were desirous to attain.</p>

<p>The torrent of irrational superstitions which carried all before it in the
fifth century, and the progress of ascetic enthusiasm, had an influence
still more decidedly inimical to learning. I cannot indeed conceive any
state of society more adverse to the intellectual improvement of mankind
than one which admitted of no middle line between gross dissoluteness and
fanatical mortification. An equable tone of public morals, social and
humane, verging neither to voluptuousness nor austerity, seems the most
adapted to genius, or at least to letters, as it is to individual comfort
and national prosperity. After the introduction of monkery and its
unsocial theory of duties, the serious and reflecting part of mankind, on
whom science most relies, were turned to habits which, in the most
favourable view, could not quicken the intellectual energies; and it might
be a difficult question whether the cultivators and admirers of useful
literature were less likely to be found among the profligate citizens of
Rome and their barbarian conquerors or the melancholy recluses of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>Such therefore was the state of learning before the subversion of the
Western Empire. And we may form some notion how little probability there
was of its producing any excellent fruits, even if that revolution had
never occurred, by considering what took place in Greece during the
subsequent ages; where, although there was some attention shown to
preserve the best monuments of antiquity, and diligence in compiling from
them, yet no one original writer of any superior merit arose, and
learning, though plunged but for a short period into mere darkness, may be
said to have languished in a middle region of twilight for the greater
part of a thousand years.</p>

<p>But not to delay ourselves in this speculation, the final settlement of
barbarous nations in Gaul, Spain, and Italy consummated the ruin of
literature. Their first irruptions were uniformly attended with
devastation; and if some of the Gothic kings, after their establishment,
proved humane and civilized sovereigns, yet the nation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> gloried in its
original rudeness, and viewed with no unreasonable disdain arts which had
neither preserved their cultivators from corruption nor raised them from
servitude. Theodoric, the most famous of the Ostrogoth kings in Italy,
could not write his name, and is said to have restrained his countrymen
from attending those schools of learning by which he, or rather perhaps
his minister Cassiodorus, endeavoured to revive the studies of his Italian
subjects. Scarcely one of the barbarians, so long as they continued
unconfused with the native inhabitants, acquired the slightest tincture of
letters; and the praise of equal ignorance was soon aspired to and
attained by the entire mass of the Roman laity. They, however, could
hardly have divested themselves so completely of all acquaintance with
even the elements of learning, if the language in which books were written
had not ceased to be their natural dialect. This remarkable change in the
speech of France, Spain, and Italy is most intimately connected with the
extinction of learning; and there is enough of obscurity as well as of
interest in the subject to deserve some discussion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Corruption of the Latin language.</div>

<p>It is obvious, on the most cursory view of the French and Spanish
languages, that they, as well as the Italian, are derived from one common
source, the Latin. That must therefore have been at some period, and
certainly not since the establishment of the barbarous nations in Spain
and Gaul, substituted in ordinary use for the original dialects of those
countries which are generally supposed to have been Celtic, not
essentially differing from those which are spoken in Wales and Ireland.
Rome, says Augustin, imposed not only her yoke, but her language, upon
conquered nations. The success of such an attempt is indeed very
remarkable. Though it is the natural effect of conquest, or even of
commercial intercourse, to ingraft fresh words and foreign idioms on the
stock of the original language, yet the entire disuse of the latter, and
adoption of one radically different, scarcely takes place in the lapse of
a far longer period than that of the Roman dominion in Gaul. Thus, in part
of Britany the people speak a language which has perhaps sustained no
essential alteration from the revolution of two thousand years; and we
know how steadily another Celtic dialect has kept its ground in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> Wales,
notwithstanding English, laws and government, and the long line of
contiguous frontier which brings the natives of that principality into
contact with Englishmen. Nor did the Romans ever establish their language
(I know not whether they wished to do so) in this island, as we perceive
by that stubborn British tongue which has survived two
conquests.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>In Gaul and in Spain, however, they did succeed, as the present state of
the French and peninsular languages renders undeniable, though by gradual
changes, and not, as the Benedictine authors of the Histoire Litt√©raire de
la France seem to imagine, by a sudden and arbitrary
innovation.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> This
is neither possible in itself, nor agreeable to the testimony of Iren√¶us,
bishop of Lyons at the end of the second century, who laments the
necessity of learning Celtic.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
But although the inhabitants of these
provinces came at length to make use of Latin so completely as their
mother tongue that few vestiges of their original Celtic could perhaps be
discovered in their common speech, it does not follow that they spoke with
the pure pronunciation of Italians, far less with that conformity to the
written sounds which we assume to be essential to the expression of Latin
words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancient Latin pronunciation.</div>

<p>It appears to be taken for granted that the Romans pronounced their
language as we do at present, so far at least as the enunciation of all
the consonants, however we may admit our deviations from the classical
standard in propriety of sounds and in measure of time. Yet the example of
our own language, and of French, might show us that orthography may become
a very inadequate representative of pronunciation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> It is indeed capable
of proof that in the purest ages of Latinity some variation existed
between these two. Those numerous changes in spelling which distinguish
the same words in the poetry of Ennius and of Virgil are best explained by
the supposition of their being accommodated, to the current pronunciation.
Harsh combinations of letters, softened down through delicacy of ear or
rapidity of utterance, gradually lost their place in the written language.
Thus <i>exfregit</i> and <i>adrogavit</i> assumed a form representing their more
liquid sound; and <i>auctor</i> was latterly spelled <i>autor</i>, which has been
followed in French and Italian. <i>Autor</i> was probably so pronounced at all
times; and the orthography was afterwards corrected or corrupted,
whichever we please to say, according to the sound. We have the best
authority to assert that the final <i>m</i> was very faintly pronounced, rather
it seems as a rest and short interval between two syllables than an
articulate letter; nor indeed can we conceive upon what other ground it
was subject to elision before a vowel in verse, since we cannot suppose
that the nice ears of Rome would have submitted to a capricious rule of
poetry for which Greece presented no
analogy.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>A decisive proof, in my opinion, of the deviation which took place,
through the rapidity of ordinary elocution, from the strict laws of
enunciation, may be found in the metre of Terence. His verses, which are
absolutely refractory to the common laws of prosody, may be readily
scanned by the application of this principle. Thus, in the first act of
the Heautontimorumenos, a part selected at random, I have found, I. Vowels
contracted or dropped so as to shorten the word by a syllable; in <i>rei</i>,
<i>vi√¢</i>, <i>diutius</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>solius</i>, <i>eam</i>, <i>unius</i>, <i>suam</i>, <i>divitias</i>,
<i>senex</i>, <i>voluptatem</i>, <i>illius</i>, <i>semel</i>; II. The proceleusmatic foot, or
four short syllables, instead of the dactyl; scen. i. v. 59, 73, 76, 88,
109; scen. ii. v. 36; III. The elision of <i>s</i> in words ending with <i>us</i> or
<i>is</i> short, and sometimes even of the whole syllable, before the next word
beginning with a vowel; in scen. i. v. 30, 81, 98, 101, 116, 119; scen.
ii. v. 28.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
IV. The first syllable of <i>ille</i> is repeatedly shortened, and
indeed nothing is more usual in Terence than this licence; whence we may
collect how ready this word was for abbreviation into the French and
Italian articles. V. The last letter of <i>apud</i> is cut off, scen. i. v.
120; and scen. ii. v. 8. VI. <i>Hodie</i> is used as a pyrrhichius, in scen.
ii. v. 11. VII. Lastly, there is a clear instance of a short syllable, the
antepenultimate of <i>impulerim</i>, lengthened on account of the accent at the
113th verse of the first scene.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its corruption by the populace,</div>

<div class="sidenote">and the provincials.</div>

<p>These licences are in all probability chiefly colloquial, and would not
have been adopted in public harangues, to which the precepts of rhetorical
writers commonly relate. But if the more elegant language of the Romans,
since such we must suppose to have been copied by Terence for his higher
characters, differed so much in ordinary discourse from their orthography,
it is probable that the vulgar went into much greater deviations. The
popular pronunciation errs generally, we might say perhaps invariably, by
abbreviation of words, and by liquefying consonants, as is natural to the
rapidity of colloquial speech.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
It is by their knowledge of
orthography and etymology that the more educated part of the community is
preserved from these corrupt modes of pronunciation. There is always
therefore a standard by which common speech may be rectified; and in
proportion to the diffusion of knowledge and politeness the deviations
from it will be more slight and gradual. But in distant provinces, and
especially where the language itself is but of recent introduction, many
more changes may be expected to occur. Even in France and England there
are provincial dialects, which, if written with all their anomalies of
pronunciation as well as idiom, would seem strangely out of unison with
the regular language; and in Italy, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> is well known, the varieties of
dialect are still more striking. Now, in an advancing state of society,
and especially with such a vigorous political circulation as we experience
in England, language will constantly approximate to uniformity, as
provincial expressions are more and more rejected for incorrectness or
inelegance. But, where literature is on the decline, and public
misfortunes contract the circle of those who are solicitous about
refinement, as in the last ages of the Roman empire, there will be no
longer any definite standard of living speech, nor any general desire to
conform to it if one could be found; and thus the vicious corruptions of
the vulgar will entirely predominate. The niceties of ancient idiom will
be totally lost, while new idioms will be formed out of violations of
grammar sanctioned by usage, which, among a civilized people, would have
been proscribed at their appearance.</p>

<p>Such appears to have been the progress of corruption in the Latin
language. The adoption of words from the Teutonic dialects of the
barbarians, which took place very freely, would not of itself have
destroyed the character of that language, though it sullied its purity.
The worst law Latin of the middle ages is still Latin, if its barbarous
terms have been bent to the regular inflections. It is possible, on the
other hand, to write whole pages of Italian, wherein every word shall be
of unequivocal Latin derivation, though the character and personality, if
I may so say, of the language be entirely dissimilar. But, as I conceive,
the loss of literature took away the only check upon arbitrary
pronunciation and upon erroneous grammar. Each people innovated through
caprice, imitation of their neighbours, or some of those indescribable
causes which dispose the organs of different nations to different sounds.
The French melted down the middle consonants; the Italians omitted the
final. Corruptions arising out of ignorance were mingled with those of
pronunciation. It would have been marvellous if illiterate and
semi-barbarous provincials had preserved that delicate precision in using
the inflections of tenses which our best scholars do not clearly attain.
The common speech of any people whose language is highly complicated will
be full of solecisms. The French inflections are not comparable in number or delicacy to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the Latin, and yet the vulgar confuse their most ordinary
forms.</p>

<p>But, in all probability, the variation of these derivative languages from
popular Latin has been considerably less than it appears. In the purest
ages of Latinity the citizens of Rome itself made use of many terms which
we deem barbarous, and of many idioms which we should reject as modern.
That highly complicated grammar, which the best writers employed, was too
elliptical and obscure, too deficient in the connecting parts of speech,
for general use. We cannot indeed ascertain in what degree the vulgar
Latin differed from that of Cicero or Seneca. It would be highly absurd to
imagine, as some are said to have done, that modern Italian was spoken at
Rome under Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
But I believe it may be asserted not only that
much the greater part of those words in the present language of Italy
which strike us as incapable of a Latin etymology are in fact derived from
those current in the Augustan age, but that very many phrases which
offended nicer ears prevailed in the same vernacular speech, and have
passed from thence into the modern French and Italian. Such, for example,
was the frequent use of prepositions to indicate a relation between two
parts of a sentence which a classical writer would have made to depend on
mere inflection.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<p>From the difficulty of retaining a right discrimination of tense seems to
have proceeded the active auxiliary verb. It is possible that this was
borrowed from the Teutonic languages of the barbarians, and accommodated
both by them and by the natives to words of Latin origin. The passive
auxiliary is obtained by a very ready resolution of any tense in that
mood, and has not been altogether dispensed with even in Greek, while in
Latin it is used much more frequently. It is not quite so easy to perceive
the propriety of the active habeo or teneo, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> or both of which all
modern languages have adopted as their auxiliaries in conjugating the
verb. But in some instances this analysis is not improper; and it may be
supposed that nations, careless of etymology or correctness, applied the
same verb by a rude analogy to cases where it ought not strictly to have
been employed.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<p>Next to the changes founded on pronunciation and to the substitution of
auxiliary verbs for inflections, the usage of the definite and indefinite
articles in nouns appears the most considerable step in the transmutation
of Latin into its derivative languages. None but Latin, I believe, has
ever wanted this part of speech; and the defect to which custom reconciled
the Romans would be an insuperable stumbling-block to nations who were to
translate their original idiom into that language. A coarse expedient of
applying <i>unus</i>, <i>ipse</i>, or <i>ille</i> to the purposes of an article might
perhaps be no unfrequent vulgarism of the provincials; and after the
Teutonic tribes brought in their own grammar, it was natural that a
corruption should become universal, which in fact supplied a real and
essential deficiency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pronunciation no longer regulated by quantity.</div>

<p>That the quantity of Latin syllables is neglected, or rather lost, in
modern pronunciation, seems to be generally admitted. Whether, indeed, the
ancient Romans, in their ordinary speaking, distinguished the measure of
syllables with such uniform musical accuracy as we imagine, giving a
certain time to those termed long, and exactly half that duration to the
short, might very reasonably be questioned; though this was probably done,
or attempted to be done, by every reader of poetry. Certainly, however,
the laws of quantity were forgotten, and an accentual pronunciation came
to predominate, before Latin had ceased to be a living language. A
Christian writer named Commodianus, who lived before the end of the third
century according to some, or, as others think, in the reign of
Constantine, has left us a philological curiosity, in a series of attacks
on the pagan superstitions, composed in what are meant to be verses,
regulated by accent instead of quantity, exactly as we read Virgil at
present.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
It is not improbable that Commodianus may have written in Africa, the
province in which more than any the purity of Latin was debased. At the
end of the fourth century St. Augustin assailed his old enemies, the
Donatists, with nearly the same arms that Commodianus had wielded against
heathenism. But as the refined and various music of hexameters was
unlikely to be relished by the vulgar, he prudently adopted a different
measure.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
All the nations of Europe seem to love the trochaic verse;
it was frequent on the Greek and Roman stage; it is more common than any
other in the popular poetry of modern languages. This proceeds from its
simplicity, its liveliness, and its ready accommodation to dancing and
music. In St. Austin's poem he united to a trochaic measure the novel
attraction of rhyme.</p>

<p>As Africa must have lost all regard to the rules of measure in the fourth
century, so it appears that Gaul was not more correct in the next two
ages. A poem addressed by Auspicius bishop of Toul to count Arbogastes, of
earlier date probably than the invasion of Clovis, is written with no
regard to quantity.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
bishop by whom this was composed is
mentioned by his contemporaries as a man of learning. Probably he did not
choose to perplex the barbarian to whom he was writing (for Arbogastes is
plainly a barbarous name) by legitimate Roman metre. In the next century
Gregory of Tours informs us that Chilperic attempted to write Latin
verses; but the lines could not be reconciled to any division of feet; his
ignorance having confounded long and short syllables
together.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> Now
Chilperic must have learned to speak Latin like other kings of the Franks,
and was a smatterer in several kinds of literature. If Chilperic therefore
was not master of these distinctions, we may conclude that the bishops and
other Romans with whom he conversed did not observe them; and that his
blunders in versification arose from ignorance of rules, which, however
fit to be preserved in poetry, were entirely obsolete in the living Latin
of his age. Indeed the frequency of false quantities in the poets even of
the fifth, but much more of the sixth century, is palpable. Fortunatus is
quite full of them. This seems a decisive proof that the ancient
pronunciation was lost. Avitus tells us that few preserved the proper
measure of syllables in singing. Yet he was bishop of Vienne, where a
purer pronunciation might be expected than in the remoter parts of
Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Change of Latin into Romance.</div>

<p>Defective, however, as it had become in respect of pronunciation, Latin
was still spoken in France during the sixth and seventh centuries. We have
compositions of that time, intended for the people, in grammatical
language. A song is still extant in rhyme and loose accentual measure,
written upon a victory of Clotaire II. over the Saxons in 622, and
obviously intended for circulation among the
people.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> Fortunatus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
says, in his Life of St. Aubin of Angers, that he should take care not to
use any expression unintelligible to the
people.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
Baudemind, in the
middle of the seventh century, declares, in his Life of St. Amand, that he
writes in a rustic and vulgar style, that the reader may be excited to
imitation.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
Not that these legends were actually perused by the
populace, for the very art of reading was confined to a few. But they were
read publicly in the churches, and probably with a pronunciation
accommodated to the corruptions of ordinary language. Still the Latin
syntax must have been tolerably understood; and we may therefore say that
Latin had not ceased to be a living language, in Gaul at least, before the
latter part of the seventh century. Faults indeed against the rules of
grammar, as well as unusual idioms, perpetually occur in the best writers
of the Merovingian period, such as Gregory of Tours; while charters drawn
up by less expert scholars deviate much further from
purity.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<p>The corrupt provincial idiom became gradually more and more dissimilar to
grammatical Latin; and the lingua Romana rustica, as the vulgar <i>patois</i>
(to borrow a word that I cannot well translate) had been called, acquired
a distinct character as a new language in the eighth
century.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> Latin
orthography, which had been hitherto pretty well maintained in books,
though not always in charters, gave way to a new spelling, conformably to
the current pronunciation. Thus we find lui, for illius, in the
Formularies of Marculfus; and Tu lo juva in a liturgy of Charlemagne's
age, for Tu illum juva. When this barrier was once broken down, such a
deluge of innovation poured in that all the characteristics of Latin were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
effaced in writing as well as speaking, and the existence of a new
language became undeniable. In a council held at Tours in 813 the bishops
are ordered to have certain homilies of the fathers translated into the
rustic Roman, as well as the German
tongue.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
After this it is unnecessary to multiply proofs of the change which Latin had undergone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its corruption in Italy.</div>

<p>In Italy the progressive corruptions of the Latin language were analogous
to those which occurred in France, though we do not find in writings any
unequivocal specimens of a new formation at so early a period. But the old
inscriptions, even of the fourth and fifth centuries, are full of
solecisms and corrupt orthography. In legal instruments under the Lombard
kings the Latin inflections are indeed used, but with so little regard to
propriety that it is obvious the writers had not the slightest tincture of
grammatical knowledge. This observation extends to a very large proportion
of such documents down to the twelfth century, and is as applicable to
France and Spain as it is to Italy. In these charters the peculiar
characteristics of Italian orthography and grammar frequently appear. Thus
we find, in the eighth century, diveatis for debeatis, da for de in the
ablative, avendi for habendi, dava for dabat, cedo a deo, and ad ecclesia,
among many similar corruptions.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Latin was so changed, it is said by a
writer of Charlemagne's age, that scarcely any part of it was popularly
known. Italy indeed had suffered more than France itself by invasion, and
was reduced to a lower state of barbarism, though probably, from the
greater distinctness of pronunciation habitual to the Italians, they lost
less of their original language than the French. I do not find, however,
in the writers who have treated this subject, any express evidence of a
vulgar language distinct from Latin earlier than the close of the tenth
century, when it is said in the epitaph of Pope Gregory V., who died in
999, that he instructed the people in three dialects&mdash;the Frankish or
German, the vulgar, and the
Latin.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ignorance consequent on the disuse of Latin.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
When Latin had thus ceased to be a living language, the whole treasury of
knowledge was locked up from the eyes of the people. The few who might
have imbibed a taste for literature, if books had been accessible to them,
were reduced to abandon pursuits that could only be cultivated through a
kind of education not easily within their reach. Schools, confined to
cathedrals and monasteries, and exclusively designed for the purposes of
religion, afforded no encouragement or opportunities to the
laity.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
The worst effect was, that, as the newly-formed languages were hardly made
use of in writing, Latin being still preserved in all legal instruments
and public correspondence, the very use of letters, as well as of books,
was forgotten. For many centuries, to sum up the account of ignorance in a
word, it was rare for a layman, of whatever rank, to know how to sign his
name.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
Their charters, till the use of seals became general, were
subscribed with the mark of the cross. Still more extraordinary it was to
find one who had any tincture of learning. Even admitting every indistinct
commendation of a monkish biographer (with whom a knowledge of
church-music would pass for
literature<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>),
we could make out a very
short list of scholars. None certainly were more distinguished as such
than Charlemagne and Alfred. But the former, unless we reject a very plain
testimony, was incapable of writing;<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
and Alfred found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> difficulty in
making a translation from the pastoral instruction of St. Gregory, on
account of his imperfect knowledge of
Latin.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>Whatever mention, therefore, we find of learning and the learned during
these dark ages, must be understood to relate only to such as were within
the pale of clergy, which indeed was pretty extensive, and comprehended
many who did not exercise the offices of religious ministry. But even the
clergy were, for a long period, not very materially superior, as a body,
to the uninstructed laity. A cloud of ignorance overspread the whole face
of the church, hardly broken by a few glimmering lights, who owe much of
their distinction to the surrounding darkness. In the sixth century the
best writers in Latin were scarcely
read;<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
and perhaps from the middle
of this age to the eleventh there was, in a general view of literature,
little difference to be discerned. If we look more accurately, there will
appear certain gradual shades of twilight on each side of the greatest
obscurity. France reached her lowest point about the beginning of the
eighth century; but England was at that time more respectable, and did not
fall into complete degradation till the middle of the ninth. There could
be nothing more deplorable than the state of letters in Italy and in
England during the succeeding century; but France cannot be denied to have
been uniformly, though very slowly, progressive from the time of
Charlemagne.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Of this prevailing ignorance it is easy to produce abundant testimony.
Contracts were made verbally, for want of notaries capable of drawing up
charters; and these, when written, were frequently barbarous and
ungrammatical to an incredible degree. For some considerable intervals
scarcely any monument of literature has been preserved, except a few
jejune chronicles, the vilest legends of saints, or verses equally
destitute of spirit and metre. In almost every council the ignorance of
the clergy forms a subject for reproach. It is asserted by one held in 992
that scarcely a single person was to be found in Rome itself who knew the
first elements of letters.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Not one priest of a thousand in Spain,
about the age of Charlemagne, could address a common letter of salutation
to another.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
In England, Alfred declares that he could not recollect a
single priest south of the Thames (the most civilized part of England), at
the time of his accession, who understood the ordinary prayers, or could
translate Latin into his mother
tongue.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
Nor was this better in the
time of Dunstan, when, it is said, none of the clergy knew how to write or
translate a Latin letter.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
The homilies which they preached were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
compiled for their use by some bishops, from former works of the same
kind, or the writings of the fathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scarcity of books.</div>

<p>This universal ignorance was rendered unavoidable, among other causes, by
the scarcity of books, which could only be procured at an immense price.
From the conquest of Alexandria by the Saracens at the beginning of the
seventh century, when the Egyptian papyrus almost ceased to be imported
into Europe, to the close of the eleventh, about which time the art of
making paper from cotton rags seems to have been introduced, there were no
materials for writing except parchment, a substance too expensive to be
readily spared for mere purposes of
literature.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
Hence an unfortunate
practice gained ground, of erasing a manuscript in order to substitute
another on the same skin. This occasioned the loss of many ancient
authors, who have made way for the legends of saints, or other
ecclesiastical rubbish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of eminent men in literature.</div>

<p>If we would listen to some literary historians, we should believe that the
darkest ages contained many individuals, not only distinguished among
their contemporaries, but positively eminent for abilities and knowledge.
A proneness to extol every monk of whose production a few letters or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
devotional treatise survives, every bishop of whom it is related that he
composed homilies, runs through the laborious work of the Benedictines of
St. Maur, the Literary History of France, and, in a less degree, is
observable even in Tiraboschi, and in most books of this class. Bede,
Alcuin, Hincmar, Raban, and a number of inferior names, become real giants
of learning in their uncritical panegyrics. But one might justly say that
ignorance is the smallest defect of the writers of these dark ages.
Several of them were tolerably acquainted with books; but that wherein
they are uniformly deficient is original argument or expression. Almost
every one is a compiler of scraps from the fathers, or from such
semi-classical authors as Boethius, Cassiodorus, or Martianus
Capella.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
Indeed I am not aware that there appeared more than two
really considerable men in the republic of letters from the sixth to the
middle of the eleventh century&mdash;John, surnamed Scotus or Erigena, a native
of Ireland; and Gerbert, who became pope by the name of Silvester II.: the
first endowed with a bold and acute metaphysical genius; the second
excellent, for the time when he lived, in mathematical science and
mechanical inventions.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of the preservation of learning&mdash;religion.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
If it be demanded by what cause it happened that a few sparks of ancient
learning survived throughout this long winter, we can only ascribe their
preservation to the establishment of Christianity. Religion alone made a
bridge, as it were, across the chaos, and has linked the two periods of
ancient and modern civilization. Without this connecting principle, Europe
might indeed have awakened to intellectual pursuits, and the genius of
recent times needed not to be invigorated by the imitation of antiquity.
But the memory of Greece and Rome would have been feebly preserved by
tradition, and the monuments of those nations might have excited, on the
return of civilization, that vague sentiment of speculation and wonder
with which men now contemplate Persepolis or the Pyramids. It is not,
however, from religion simply that we have derived this advantage, but
from religion as it was modified in the dark ages. Such is the complex
reciprocation of good and evil in the dispensations of Providence, that we
may assert, with only an apparent paradox, that, had religion been more
pure, it would have been less permanent, and that Christianity has been
preserved by means of its corruptions. The sole hope for literature
depended on the Latin language; and I do not see why that should not have
been lost, if three circumstances in the prevailing religious system, all
of which we are justly accustomed to disapprove, had not conspired to
maintain it&mdash;the papal supremacy, the monastic institutions, and the use
of a Latin liturgy. 1. A continual intercourse was kept up, in consequence
of the first, between Rome and the several nations of Europe; her laws
were received by the bishops, her legates presided in councils; so that a
common language was as necessary in the church as it is at present in the
diplomatic relations of kingdoms. 2. Throughout the whole course of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> the
middle ages there was no learning, and very little regularity of manners,
among the parochial clergy. Almost every distinguished man was either the
member of a chapter or of a convent. The monasteries were subjected to
strict rules of discipline, and held out, at the worst, more opportunities
for study than the secular clergy possessed, and fewer for worldly
dissipations. But their most important service was as secure repositories
for books. All our manuscripts have been preserved in this manner, and
could hardly have descended to us by any other channel; at least there
were intervals when I do not conceive that any royal or private libraries
existed.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
3. Monasteries, however, would probably have contributed
very little towards the preservation of learning, if the Scriptures and
the liturgy had been translated out of Latin when that language ceased to
be intelligible. Every rational principle of religious worship called for
such a change; but it would have been made at the expense of posterity.
One might presume, if such refined conjectures were consistent with
historical caution, that the more learned and sagacious ecclesiastics of
those times, deploring the gradual corruption of the Latin tongue, and the
danger of its absolute extinction, were induced to maintain it as a sacred
language, and the depository, as it were, of that truth and that science
which would be lost in the barbarous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> dialects of the vulgar. But a
simpler explanation is found in the radical dislike of innovation which is
natural to an established clergy. Nor did they want as good pretexts, on
the ground of convenience, as are commonly alleged by the opponents of
reform. They were habituated to the Latin words of the church-service,
which had become, by this association, the readiest instruments of
devotion, and with the majesty of which the Romance jargon could bear no
comparison. Their musical chants were adapted to these sounds, and their
hymns depended, for metrical effect, on the marked accents and powerful
rhymes which the Latin language affords. The vulgate Latin of the Bible
was still more venerable. It was like a copy of a lost original; and a
copy attested by one of the most eminent fathers, and by the general
consent of the church. These are certainly no adequate excuses for keeping
the people in ignorance; and the gross corruption of the middle ages is in
a great degree assignable to this policy. But learning, and consequently
religion, have eventually derived from it the utmost advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superstitions.</div>

<p>In the shadows of this universal ignorance a thousand superstitions, like
foul animals of night, were propagated and nourished. It would be very
unsatisfactory to exhibit a few specimens of this odious brood, when the
real character of those times is only to be judged by their accumulated
multitude. In every age it would be easy to select proofs of irrational
superstition, which, separately considered, seem to degrade mankind from
its level in the creation; and perhaps the contemporaries of Swedenborg
and Southcote have no right to look very contemptuously upon the
fanaticism of their ancestors. There are many books from which a
sufficient number of instances may be collected to show the absurdity and
ignorance of the middle ages in this respect. I shall only mention two, as
affording more general evidence than any local or obscure superstition. In
the tenth century an opinion prevailed everywhere that the end of the
world was approaching. Many charters begin with these words, "As the world
is now drawing to its close." An army marching under the emperor Otho I.
was so terrified by an eclipse of the sun, which it conceived to announce
this consummation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
as to disperse hastily on all sides. As this notion
seems to have been founded on some confused theory of the millennium, it
naturally died away when the seasons proceeded in the eleventh century
with their usual regularity.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
A far more remarkable and permanent
superstition was the appeal to Heaven in judicial controversies, whether
through the means of combat or of ordeal. The principle of these was the
same; but in the former it was mingled with feelings independent of
religion&mdash;the natural dictates of resentment in a brave man unjustly
accused, and the sympathy of a warlike people with the display of skill
and intrepidity. These, in course of time, almost obliterated the primary
character of judicial combat, and ultimately changed it into the modern
duel, in which assuredly there is no mixture of
superstition.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
But, in the various tests of innocence which were called ordeals, this stood
undisguised and unqualified. It is not necessary to describe what is so
well known&mdash;the ceremonies of trial by handling hot iron, by plunging the
arm into boiling fluids, by floating or sinking in cold water, or by
swallowing a piece of consecrated bread. It is observable that, as the
interference of Heaven was relied upon as a matter of course, it seems to
have been reckoned nearly indifferent whether such a test was adopted as
must, humanly considered, absolve all the guilty, or one that must convict
all the innocent. The ordeals of hot iron or water were, however, more
commonly used; and it has been a perplexing question by what dexterity
these tremendous proofs were eluded. They seem at least to have placed the
decision of all judicial controversies in the hands of the clergy, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
must have known the secret, whatever that might be, of satisfying the
spectators that an accused person had held a mass of burning iron with
impunity. For several centuries this mode of investigation was in great
repute, though not without opposition from some eminent bishops. It does
discredit to the memory of Charlemagne that he was one of its warmest
advocates.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
But the judicial combat, which indeed might be reckoned
one species of ordeal, gradually put an end to the rest; and as the church
acquired better notions of law, and a code of her own, she strenuously
exerted herself against all these barbarous
superstitions.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Enthusiastic risings.</div>

<p>But the religious ignorance of the middle ages sometimes burst out in
ebullitions of epidemical enthusiasm, more remarkable than these
superstitious usages, though proceeding in fact from similar causes. For
enthusiasm is little else than superstition put in motion, and is equally
founded on a strong conviction of supernatural agency without any just
conceptions of its nature. Nor has any denomination of Christians
produced, or even sanctioned, more fanaticism than the church of Rome.
These epidemical frenzies, however, to which I am alluding, were merely tumultuous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
though certainly fostered by the creed of perpetual miracles
which the clergy inculcated, and drawing a legitimate precedent for
religious insurrection from the crusades. For these, among other evil
consequences, seem to have principally excited a wild fanaticism that did
not sleep for several centuries.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[z]</a></p>

<p>The first conspicuous appearance of it was in the reign of Philip
Augustus, when the mercenary troops, dismissed from the pay of that prince
and of Henry II., committed the greatest outrages in the south of France.
One Durand, a carpenter, deluded it is said by a contrived appearance of
the Virgin, put himself at the head of an army of the populace, in order
to destroy these marauders. His followers were styled Brethren of the
White Caps, from the linen coverings of their heads. They bound themselves
not to play at dice nor frequent taverns, to wear no affected clothing, to
avoid perjury and vain swearing. After some successes over the plunderers,
they went so far as to forbid the lords to take any dues from their
vassals, on pain of incurring the indignation of the brotherhood. It may
easily be imagined that they were soon entirely discomfited, so that no
one dared to own that he had belonged to them.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>During the captivity of St. Louis in Egypt, a more extensive and terrible
ferment broke out in Flanders, and spread from thence over great part of
France. An impostor declared himself commissioned by the Virgin to preach
a crusade, not to the rich and noble, who for their pride had been
rejected of God, but the poor. His disciples were called Pastoureaux, the
simplicity of shepherds having exposed them more readily to this delusion.
In a short time they were swelled by the confluence of abundant streams to
a moving mass of a hundred thousand men, divided into companies, with
banners bearing a cross and a lamb, and commanded by the impostor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
lieutenants. He assumed a priestly character, preaching, absolving,
annulling marriages. At Amiens, Bourges, Orleans, and Paris itself, he was
received as a divine prophet. Even the regent Blanche, for a time, was led
away by the popular tide. His main topic was reproach of the clergy for
their idleness and corruption&mdash;a theme well adapted to the ears of the
people, who had long been uttering similar strains of complaint. In some
towns his followers massacred the priests and plundered the monasteries.
The government at length began to exert itself; and the public sentiment
turning against the authors of so much confusion, this rabble was put to
the sword or dissipated.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
Seventy years afterwards an insurrection,
almost exactly parallel to this, burst out under the same pretence of a
crusade. These insurgents, too, bore the name of Pastoureaux, and their
short career was distinguished by a general massacre of the
Jews.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p>But though the contagion of fanaticism spreads much more rapidly among the
populace, and in modern times is almost entirely confined to it, there
were examples, in the middle ages, of an epidemical religious lunacy, from
which no class was exempt. One of these occurred about the year 1260, when
a multitude of every rank, age, and sex, marching two by two in procession
along the streets and public roads, mingled groans and dolorous hymns with
the sound of leathern scourges which they exercised upon their naked
backs. From this mark of penitence, which, as it bears at least all the
appearance of sincerity, is not uncommon in the church of Rome, they
acquired the name of Flagellants. Their career began, it is said, at
Perugia, whence they spread over the rest of Italy, and into Germany and
Poland. As this spontaneous fanaticism met with no encouragement from the
church, and was prudently discountenanced by the civil magistrate, it died
away in a very short time.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
But it is more surprising that, after
almost a century and a half of continual improvement and illumination,
another irruption of popular extravagance burst out under circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
exceedingly similar.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
"In the month of August 1399," says a
contemporary historian, "there appeared all over Italy a description of
persons, called Bianchi, from the white linen vestment that they wore.
They passed from province to province, and from city to city, crying out
Misericordia! with their faces covered and bent towards the ground, and
bearing before them a great crucifix. Their constant song was Stabat Mater
dolorosa. This lasted three months; and whoever did not attend their
procession was reputed a heretic."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
Almost every Italian writer of the
time takes notice of these Bianchi; and Muratori ascribes a remarkable
reformation of manners (though certainly a very transient one) to their
influence.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
Nor were they confined to Italy, though no such
meritorious exertions are imputed to them in other countries. In France
their practice of covering the face gave such opportunity to crimes as to
be prohibited by the government;<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
and we have an act on the rolls of
the first parliament of Henry IV., forbidding any one, "under pain of
forfeiting all his worth, to receive the new sect in white clothes,
pretending to great sanctity," which had recently appeared in foreign
parts.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pretended miracles.</div>

<p>The devotion of the multitude was wrought to this feverish height by the
prevailing system of the clergy. In that singular polytheism, which had
been grafted on Christianity, nothing was so conspicuous as the belief of
perpetual miracles&mdash;if indeed those could properly be termed miracles
which, by their constant recurrence, even upon trifling occasions, might
seem within the ordinary dispensations of Providence. These superstitions
arose in what are called primitive times, and are certainly no part of
popery, if in that word we include any especial reference to the Roman
see. But successive ages of ignorance swelled the delusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
to such an enormous pitch, that it was as difficult to trace, we may say without
exaggeration, the real religion of the Gospel in the popular belief of the
laity, as the real history of Charlemagne in the romance of Turpin. It
must not be supposed that these absurdities were produced, as well as
nourished, by ignorance. In most cases they were the work of deliberate
imposture. Every cathedral or monastery had its tutelar saint, and every
saint his legend, fabricated in order to enrich the churches under his
protection, by exaggerating his virtues, his miracles, and consequently
his power of serving those who paid liberally for his
patronage.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[k]</a> Many
of those saints were imaginary persons; sometimes a blundered inscription
added a name to the calendar, and sometimes, it is said, a heathen god was
surprised at the company to which he was introduced, and the rites with
which he was honoured.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mischiefs arising from this superstition.</div>

<p>It would not be consonant to the nature of the present work to dwell upon
the erroneousness of this religion; but its effect upon the moral and
intellectual character of mankind was so prominent, that no one can take a
philosophical view of the middle ages without attending more than is at
present fashionable to their ecclesiastical history. That the exclusive
worship of saints, under the guidance of an artful though illiterate
priesthood, degraded the understanding and begot a stupid credulity and
fanaticism, is sufficiently evident. But it was also so managed as to
loosen the bonds of religion and pervert the standard of morality. If
these inhabitants of heaven had been represented as stern avengers,
accepting no slight atonement for heavy offences, and prompt to interpose
their control over natural events for the detection and punishment of
guilt, the creed, however impossible to be reconciled with experience,
might have proved a salutary check upon a rude people, and would at least
have had the only palliation that can be offered for a religious
imposture, its political expediency. In the legends of those times, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the contrary, they appeared only as perpetual intercessors, so
good-natured and so powerful, that a sinner was more emphatically foolish
than he is usually represented if he failed to secure himself against any
bad consequences. For a little attention to the saints, and especially to
the Virgin, with due liberality to their servants, had saved, he would be
told, so many of the most atrocious delinquents, that he might equitably
presume upon similar luck in his own case.</p>

<p>This monstrous superstition grew to its height in the twelfth century. For
the advance that learning then made was by no means sufficient to
counteract the vast increase of monasteries, and the opportunities which
the greater cultivation of modern languages afforded for the diffusion of
legendary tales. It was now, too, that the veneration paid to the Virgin,
in early times very great, rose to an almost exclusive idolatry. It is
difficult to conceive the stupid absurdity and the disgusting profaneness
of those stories which were invented by the monks to do her honour. A few
examples have been thrown into a
note.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Not altogether unmixed with good.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Whether the superstition of these dark ages had actually passed that point
when it becomes more injurious to public morals and the welfare of society
than the entire absence of all religious notions is a very complex
question, upon which I would by no means pronounce an affirmative
decision.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
A salutary influence, breathed from the spirit of a more
genuine religion, often displayed itself among the corruptions of a
degenerate superstition. In the original principles of monastic orders,
and the rules by which they ought at least to have been governed, there
was a character of meekness, self-denial, and charity that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> could not
wholly be effaced. These virtues, rather than justice and veracity, were
inculcated by the religious ethics of the middle ages; and in the relief
of indigence it may, upon the whole, be asserted that the monks did not
fall short of their profession.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
This eleemosynary spirit indeed
remarkably distinguishes both Christianity and Mohammedism from the moral
systems of Greece and Rome, which were very deficient in general humanity
and sympathy with suffering. Nor do we find in any single instance during
ancient times, if I mistake not, those public institutions for the
alleviation of human miseries which have long been scattered over every
part of Europe. The virtues of the monks assumed a still higher character
when they stood forward as protectors of the oppressed. By an established
law, founded on very ancient superstition, the precincts of a church
afforded sanctuary to accused persons. Under a due administration of
justice this privilege would have been simply and constantly mischievous,
as we properly consider it to be in those countries where it still
subsists. But in the rapine and tumult of the middle ages the right of
sanctuary might as often be a shield to innocence as an immunity to crime.
We can hardly regret, in reflecting on the desolating violence which
prevailed, that there should have been some green spots in the wilderness
where the feeble and the persecuted could find refuge. How must this right
have enhanced the veneration for religious institutions! How gladly must
the victims of internal warfare have turned their eyes from the baronial
castle, the dread and scourge of the neighbourhood, to those venerable
walls within which not even the clamour of arms could be heard to disturb
the chant of holy men and the sacred service of the altar! The protection of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the sanctuary was never withheld. A son of Chilperic king of France
having fled to that of Tours, his father threatened to ravage all the
lands of the church unless they gave him up. Gregory the historian, bishop
of the city, replied in the name of his clergy that Christians could not
be guilty of an act unheard of among pagans. The king was as good as his
word, and did not spare the estate of the church, but dared not infringe
its privileges. He had indeed previously addressed a letter to St. Martin,
which was laid on his tomb in the church, requesting permission to take
away his son by force; but the honest saint returned no
answer.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vices of the monks and clergy.</div>

<p>The virtues indeed, or supposed virtues, which had induced a credulous
generation to enrich so many of the monastic orders, were not long
preserved. We must reject, in the excess of our candour, all testimonies
that the middle ages present, from the solemn declaration of councils and
reports of judicial inquiry to the casual evidence of common fame in the
ballad or romance, if we would extenuate the general corruption of those
institutions. In vain new rules of discipline were devised, or the old
corrected by reforms. Many of their worst vices grew so naturally out of
their mode of life, that a stricter discipline could have no tendency to
extirpate them. Such were the frauds I have already noticed, and the whole
scheme of hypocritical austerities. Their extreme licentiousness was
sometimes hardly concealed by the cowl of sanctity. I know not by what
right we should disbelieve the reports of the visitation under Henry
VIII., entering as they do into a multitude of specific charges both
probable in their nature and consonant to the unanimous opinion of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
Doubtless there were many communities, as well as individuals,
to whom none of these reproaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
would apply. In the very best view,
however, that can be taken of monasteries, their existence is deeply
injurious to the general morals of a nation. They withdraw men of pure
conduct and conscientious principles from the exercise of social duties,
and leave the common mass of human vice more unmixed. Such men are always
inclined to form schemes of ascetic perfection, which can only be
fulfilled in retirement; but in the strict rules of monastic life, and
under the influence of a grovelling superstition, their virtue lost all
its usefulness. They fell implicitly into the snares of crafty priests,
who made submission to the church not only the condition but the measure
of all praise. "He is a good Christian," says Eligius, a saint of the
seventh century, "who comes frequently to church; who presents an oblation
that it may be offered to God on the altar; who does not taste the fruits
of his land till he has consecrated a part of them to God; who can repeat
the Creed or the Lord's Prayer. Redeem your souls from punishment while it
is in your power; offer presents and tithes to churches, light candles in
holy places, as much as you can afford, come more frequently to church,
implore the protection of the saints; for, if you observe these things,
you may come with security at the day of judgment to say, Give unto us,
Lord, for we have given unto thee."<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[s]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
With such a definition of the Christian character, it is not surprising
that any fraud and injustice became honourable when it contributed to the
riches of the clergy and glory of their order. Their frauds, however, were
less atrocious than the savage bigotry with which they maintained their
own system and infected the laity. In Saxony, Poland, Lithuania, and the
countries on the Baltic Sea, a sanguinary persecution extirpated the
original idolatry. The Jews were everywhere the objects of popular insult
and oppression, frequently of a general massacre, though protected, it
must be confessed, by the laws of the church, as well as in general by
temporal princes.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
Of the crusades it is only necessary to repeat that
they began in a tremendous eruption of fanaticism, and ceased only because
that spirit could not be constantly kept alive. A similar influence
produced the devastation of Languedoc, the stakes and scaffolds of the
Inquisition, and rooted in the religious theory of Europe those maxims of
intolerance which it has so slowly, and still perhaps so imperfectly,
renounced.</p>

<p>From no other cause are the dictates of sound reason and the moral sense
of mankind more confused than by this narrow theological bigotry. For as
it must often happen that men to whom the arrogance of a prevailing
faction imputes religious error are exemplary for their performance of
moral duties, these virtues gradually cease to make their proper
impression, and are depreciated by the rigidly orthodox as of little value
in comparison with just opinions in speculative points. On the other hand,
vices are forgiven to those who are zealous in the faith. I speak too
gently, and with a view to later times; in treating of the dark ages it
would be more correct to say that crimes were commended. Thus Gregory of
Tours, a saint of the church, after relating a most atrocious story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> of
Clovis&mdash;the murder of a prince whom he had previously instigated to
parricide&mdash;continues the sentence: "For God daily subdued his enemies to
his hand, and increased his kingdom; because he walked before him in
uprightness, and did what was pleasing in his
eyes."<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Commutation of penances.</div>

<p>It is a frequent complaint of ecclesiastical writers that the rigorous
penances imposed by the primitive canons upon delinquents were commuted in
a laxer state of discipline for less severe atonements, and ultimately
indeed for money.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
We must not, however, regret that the clergy should
have lost the power of compelling men to abstain fifteen years from eating
meat, or to stand exposed to public derision at the gates of a church.
Such implicit submissiveness could only have produced superstition and
hypocrisy among the laity, and prepared the road for a tyranny not less
oppressive than that of India or ancient Egypt. Indeed the two earliest
instances of ecclesiastical interference with the rights of
sovereigns&mdash;namely, the deposition of Wamba in Spain and that of Louis the
Debonair&mdash;were founded upon this austere system of penitence. But it is
true that a repentance redeemed by money or performed by a substitute
could have no salutary effect on the sinner; and some of the modes of
atonement which the church most approved were particularly hostile to
public morals. None was so usual as pilgrimage, whether to Jerusalem or
Rome, which were the great objects of devotion; or to the shrine of some
national saint&mdash;a James of Compostella, a David, or a Thomas √† Becket.
This licensed vagrancy was naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> productive of dissoluteness,
especially among the women. Our English ladies, in their zeal to obtain
the spiritual treasures of Rome, are said to have relaxed the necessary
caution about one that was in their own
custody.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> There is a
capitulary of Charlemagne directed against itinerant penitents, who
probably considered the iron chain around their necks an expiation of
future as well as past
offences.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[z]</a></p>

<p>The crusades may be considered as martial pilgrimages on an enormous
scale, and their influence upon general morality seems to have been
altogether pernicious. Those who served under the cross would not indeed
have lived very virtuously at home; but the confidence in their own
merits, which the principle of such expeditions inspired, must have
aggravated the ferocity and dissoluteness of their ancient habits. Several
historians attest the depravation of morals which existed both among the
crusaders and in the states formed out of their
conquests.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of law.</div>

<p>While religion had thus lost almost every quality that renders it
conducive to the good order of society, the control of human law was still
less efficacious. But this part of my subject has been anticipated in
other passages of the present work; and I shall only glance at the want of
regular subordination, which rendered legislative and judicial edicts a
dead letter, and at the incessant private warfare, rendered legitimate by
the usages of most continental nations. Such hostilities, conducted as
they must usually have been with injustice and cruelty, could not fail to
produce a degree of rapacious ferocity in the general disposition of a
people. And this certainly was among the characteristics of every nation
for many centuries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Degradation of morals.</div>

<p>It is easy to infer the degradation of society during the dark ages from
the state of religion and police. Certainly there are a few great
landmarks of moral distinctions so deeply fixed in human nature, that no
degree of rudeness can destroy, nor even any superstition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
remove them. Wherever an extreme corruption has in any particular society defaced these
sacred archetypes that are given to guide and correct the sentiments of
mankind, it is in the course of Providence that the society itself should
perish by internal discord or the sword of a conqueror. In the worst ages
of Europe there must have existed the seeds of social virtues, of
fidelity, gratitude, and disinterestedness, sufficient at least to
preserve the public approbation of more elevated principles than the
public conduct displayed. Without these imperishable elements there could
have been no restoration of the moral energies; nothing upon which
reformed faith, revived knowledge, renewed law, could exercise their
nourishing influences. But history, which reflects only the more prominent
features of society, cannot exhibit the virtues that were scarcely able to
struggle through the general depravation. I am aware that a tone of
exaggerated declamation is at all times usual with those who lament the
vices of their own time; and writers of the middle ages are in abundant
need of allowance on this score. Nor is it reasonable to found any
inferences as to the general condition of society on single instances of
crimes, however atrocious, especially when committed under the influence
of violent passion. Such enormities are the fruit of every age, and none
is to be measured by them. They make, however, a strong impression at the
moment, and thus find a place in contemporary annals, from which modern
writers are commonly glad to extract whatever may seem to throw light upon
manners. I shall, therefore, abstain from producing any particular cases
of dissoluteness or cruelty from the records of the middle ages, lest I
should weaken a general proposition by offering an imperfect induction to
support it, and shall content myself with observing that times to which
men sometimes appeal, as to a golden period, were far inferior in every
moral comparison to those in which we are
thrown.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
One crime, as more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
universal and characteristic than others, may be particularly noticed. All
writers agree in the prevalence of judicial perjury. It seems to have
almost invariably escaped human punishment; and the barriers of
superstition were in this, as in every other instance, too feeble to
prevent the commission of crimes. Many of the proofs by ordeal were
applied to witnesses as well as those whom they accused; and undoubtedly
trial by combat was preserved in a considerable degree on account of the
difficulty experienced in securing a just cause against the perjury of
witnesses. Robert king of France, perceiving how frequently men forswore
themselves upon the relics of saints, and less shocked apparently at the
crime than at the sacrilege, caused an empty reliquary of crystal to be
used, that those who touched it might incur less guilt in fact, though not
in intention. Such an anecdote characterizes both the man and the
times.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Love of field sports.</div>

<p>The favourite diversions of the middle ages, in the intervals of war, were
those of hunting and hawking. The former must in all countries be a source
of pleasure; but it seems to have been enjoyed in moderation by the Greeks
and the Romans. With the northern invaders, however, it was rather a
predominant appetite than an amusement; it was their pride and their
ornament, the theme of their songs, the object of their laws, and the
business of their lives. Falconry, unknown as a diversion to the ancients,
became from the fourth century an equally delightful
occupation.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> From
the Salic and other barbarous codes of the fifth century to the close of
the period under our review, every age would furnish testimony to the
ruling passion for these two species of chace, or, as they were sometimes called,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the mysteries of woods and rivers. A knight seldom stirred from
his house without a falcon on his wrist or a greyhound that followed him.
Thus are Harold and his attendants represented, in the famous tapestry of
Bayeux. And in the monuments of those who died anywhere but on the field
of battle, it is usual to find the greyhound lying at their feet, or the
bird upon their wrists. Nor are the tombs of ladies without their falcon;
for this diversion, being of less danger and fatigue than the chace, was
shared by the delicate sex.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<p>It was impossible to repress the eagerness with which the clergy,
especially after the barbarians were tempted by rich bishoprics to take
upon them the sacred functions, rushed into these secular amusements.
Prohibitions of councils, however frequently repeated, produced little
effect. In some instances a particular monastery obtained a dispensation.
Thus that of St. Denis, in 774, represented to Charlemagne that the flesh
of hunted animals was salutary for sick monks, and that their skins would
serve to bind the books in the
library.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
Reasons equally cogent, we
may presume, could not be wanting in every other case. As the bishops and
abbots were perfectly feudal lords, and often did not scruple to lead
their vassals into the field, it was not to be expected that they should
debar themselves of an innocent pastime. It was hardly such indeed, when
practised at the expense of others. Alexander III., by a letter to the
clergy of Berkshire, dispenses with their keeping the archdeacon in dogs
and hawks during his
visitation.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
This season gave jovial
ecclesiastics an opportunity of trying different countries. An archbishop
of York, in 1321, seems to have carried a train of two hundred persons,
who were maintained at the expense of the abbeys on his road, and to have
hunted with a pack of hounds from parish to
parish.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
The third council
of Lateran, in 1180, had prohibited this amusement on such journeys, and
restricted bishops to a train of forty or fifty
horses.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<p>Though hunting had ceased to be a necessary means of procuring food, it
was a very convenient resource, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
which the wholesomeness and comfort,
as well as the luxury, of the table depended. Before the natural pastures
were improved, and new kinds of fodder for cattle discovered, it was
impossible to maintain the summer stock during the cold season. Hence a
portion of it was regularly slaughtered and salted for winter provision.
We may suppose that, when no alternative was offered but these salted
meats, even the leanest venison was devoured with relish. There was
somewhat more excuse therefore for the severity with which the lords of
forests and manors preserved the beasts of chace than if they had been
considered as merely objects of sport. The laws relating to preservation
of game were in every country uncommonly rigorous. They formed in England
that odious system of forest laws which distinguished the tyranny of our
Norman kings. Capital punishment for killing a stag or wild boar was
frequent, and perhaps warranted by law, until the charter of
John.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
The French code was less severe, but even Henry IV. enacted the pain of
death against the repeated offence of chasing deer in the royal forests.
The privilege of hunting was reserved to the nobility till the reign of
Louis IX., who extended it in some degree to persons of lower
birth.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<p>This excessive passion for the sports of the field produced those evils
which are apt to result from it&mdash;a strenuous idleness which disdained all
useful occupations, and an oppressive spirit towards the peasantry. The
devastation committed under the pretence of destroying wild animals, which
had been already protected in their depredations, is noticed in serious
authors, and has also been the topic of popular
ballads.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
What effect this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
must have had on agriculture it is easy to conjecture. The levelling
of forests, the draining of morasses, and the extirpation of mischievous
animals which inhabit them, are the first objects of man's labour in
reclaiming the earth to his use; and these were forbidden by a landed
aristocracy, whose control over the progress of agricultural improvement
was unlimited, and who had not yet learned to sacrifice their pleasures to
their avarice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad state of agriculture;</div>

<p>These habits of the rich, and the miserable servitude of those who
cultivated the land, rendered its fertility unavailing. Predial servitude
indeed, in some of its modifications, has always been the great bar to
improvement. In the agricultural economy of Rome the labouring husbandman,
a menial slave of some wealthy senator, had not even that qualified
interest in the soil which the tenure of villenage afforded to the peasant
of feudal ages. Italy, therefore, a country presenting many natural
impediments, was but imperfectly reduced into cultivation before the
irruption of the barbarians.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
That revolution destroyed agriculture
with every other art, and succeeding calamities during five or six
centuries left the finest regions of Europe unfruitful and desolate. There
are but two possible modes in which the produce of the earth can be
increased; one by rendering fresh land serviceable, the other by improving
the fertility of that which is already cultivated. The last is only
attainable by the application of capital and of skill to agriculture,
neither of which could be expected in the ruder ages of society. The
former is, to a certain extent, always practicable while waste lands
remain; but it was checked by laws hostile to improvement, such as the
manerial and commonable rights in England, and by the general tone of
manners.</p>

<p>Till the reign of Charlemagne there were no towns in Germany, except a few
that had been erected on the Rhine and Danube by the Romans. A house with
its stables and farm-buildings, surrounded by a hedge or enclosure, was
called a court, or, as we find it in our law-books, a curtilage; the toft
or homestead of a more genuine English dialect. One of these, with the adjacent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
domain of arable fields and woods, had the name of a villa or
manse. Several manses composed a march; and several marches formed a pagus
or district.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
From these elements in the progress of population arose
villages and towns. In France undoubtedly there were always cities of some
importance. Country parishes contained several manses or farms of arable
land, around a common pasture, where every one was bound by custom to feed
his cattle.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">of internal trade;</div>

<p>The condition even of internal trade was hardly preferable to that of
agriculture. There is not a vestige perhaps to be discovered for several
centuries of any considerable manufacture; I mean, of working up articles
of common utility to an extent beyond what the necessities of an adjacent
district required.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
Rich men kept domestic artisans among their
servants; even kings, in the ninth century, had their clothes made by the
women upon their farms;<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
but the peasantry must have been supplied
with garments and implements of labour by purchase; and every town, it
cannot be doubted, had its weaver, its smith, and its currier. But there
were almost insuperable impediments to any extended traffic&mdash;the
insecurity of moveable wealth, and difficulty of accumulating it; the
ignorance of mutual wants; the peril of robbery in conveying merchandise,
and the certainty of extortion. In the domains of every lord a toll was to
be paid in passing his bridge, or along his highway, or at his
market.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
These customs, equitable and necessary in their principle,
became in practice oppressive, because they were arbitrary, and renewed in
every petty territory which the road might intersect. Several of
Charlemagne's capitularies repeat complaints of these exactions, and
endeavour to abolish such tolls as were not founded on
prescription.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
One of them rather amusingly illustrates the modesty and moderation of the
landholders. It is enacted that no one shall be compelled to go out of his
way in order to pay toll at a particular bridge, when he can cross the
river more conveniently at another
place.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
These provisions, like most
others of that age, were unlikely to produce much amendment. It was only
the milder species, however, of feudal lords who were content with the
tribute of merchants. The more ravenous descended from their fortresses to
pillage the wealthy traveller, or shared in the spoil of inferior
plunderers, whom they both protected and instigated. Proofs occur, even in
the later periods of the middle ages, when government had regained its
energy, and civilization had made considerable progress, of public
robberies systematically perpetrated by men of noble rank. In the more
savage times, before the twelfth century, they were probably too frequent
to excite much attention. It was a custom in some places to waylay
travellers, and not only to plunder, but to sell them as slaves, or compel
them to pay a ransom. Harold son of Godwin, having been wrecked on the
coast of Ponthieu, was imprisoned by the lord, says an historian,
according to the custom of that
territory.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
Germany appears to have been, upon the whole, the country where downright robbery was most
unscrupulously practised by the great. Their castles, erected on almost
inaccessible heights among the woods, became the secure receptacles of
predatory bands, who spread terror over the country. From these barbarian
lords of the dark ages, as from a living model, the romances are said to
have drawn their giants and other disloyal enemies of true chivalry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Robbery, indeed, is the constant theme both of the Capitularies and of the
Anglo-Saxon laws; one has more reason to wonder at the intrepid thirst of
lucre, which induced a very few merchants to exchange the products of
different regions, than to ask why no general spirit of commercial
activity prevailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of foreign commerce.</div>

<p>Under all these circumstances it is obvious that very little oriental
commerce could have existed in these western countries of Europe.
Destitute as they have been created, speaking comparatively, of natural
productions fit for exportation, their invention and industry are the
great resources from which they can supply the demands of the East. Before
any manufactures were established in Europe, her commercial intercourse
with Egypt and Asia must of necessity have been very trifling; because,
whatever inclination she might feel to enjoy the luxuries of those genial
regions, she wanted the means of obtaining them. It is not therefore
necessary to rest the miserable condition of oriental commerce upon the
Saracen conquests, because the poverty of Europe is an adequate cause;
and, in fact, what little traffic remained was carried on with no material
inconvenience through the channel of Constantinople. Venice took the lead
in trading with Greece and more eastern
countries.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
Amalfi had the second place in the commerce of those dark ages. These cities imported,
besides natural productions, the fine clothes of Constantinople; yet as
this traffic seems to have been illicit, it was not probably
extensive.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Their exports were gold and silver, by which, as none was
likely to return, the circulating money of Europe was probably less in the
eleventh century than at the subversion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
of the Roman empire; furs, which
were obtained from the Sclavonian countries; and arms, the sale of which
to pagans or Saracens was vainly prohibited by Charlemagne and by the Holy
See.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
A more scandalous traffic, and one that still more fitly called
for prohibitory laws, was carried on in slaves. It is an humiliating proof
of the degradation of Christendom, that the Venetians were reduced to
purchase the luxuries of Asia by supplying the slave-market of the
Saracens.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
Their apology would perhaps have been, that these were
purchased from their heathen neighbours; but a slave-dealer was probably
not very inquisitive as to the faith or origin of his victim. This trade
was not peculiar to Venice. In England it was very common, even after the
Conquest, to export slaves to Ireland, till, in the reign of Henry II.,
the Irish came to a non-importation agreement, which put a stop to the
practice.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>From this state of degradation and poverty all the countries of Europe
have recovered, with a progression in some respects tolerably uniform, in
others more unequal; and the course of their improvement, more gradual and
less dependent upon conspicuous civil revolutions than their decline,
affords one of the most interesting subjects into which a philosophical
mind can inquire. The commencement of this restoration has usually been
dated from about the close of the eleventh century; though it is
unnecessary to observe that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
subject does not admit of anything
approximating to chronological accuracy. It may, therefore, be sometimes
not improper to distinguish the first six of the ten centuries which the
present work embraces under the appellation of the <i>dark</i> ages; an epithet
which I do not extend to the twelfth and three following. In tracing the
decline of society from the subversion of the Roman empire, we have been
led, not without connexion, from ignorance to superstition, from
superstition to vice and lawlessness, and from thence to general rudeness
and poverty. I shall pursue an inverted order in passing along the
ascending scale, and class the various improvements which took place
between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries under three principal heads,
as they relate to the wealth, the manners, or the taste and learning of
Europe. Different arrangements might probably be suggested, equally
natural and convenient; but in the disposition of topics that have not
always an unbroken connexion with each other, no method can be prescribed
as absolutely more scientific than the rest. That which I have adopted
appears to me as philosophical and as little liable to transitions as any
other.</p>

Many are still unwilling to believe that Charlemagne could not write. M.
Amp√®re observes that the emperor asserts himself to have been the author
of the Libri Carolini, and is said by some to have composed verses. Hist.
Litt. de la France, iii. 37. But did not Henry VIII. claim a book against
Luther, which was not written by himself? <i>Qui facit per alium, facit per
se</i>, is in all cases a royal prerogative. Even if the book were
Charlemagne's own, might he not have dictated it? I have been informed
that there is a manuscript at Vienna with autograph notes of Charlemagne
in the margin. But is there sufficient evidence of their genuineness? The
great difficulty is to get over the words which I have quoted from
Eginhard. M. Amp√®re ingeniously conjectures that the passage does not
relate to simple common writing, but to calligraphy; the art of
delineating characters in a beautiful manner, practised by the copyists,
and of which a contemporaneous specimen may be seen in the well-known
Bible of the British Museum. Yet it must be remembered that Charlemagne's
early life passed in the depths of ignorance; and Eginhard gives a fair
reason why he failed in acquiring the art of writing, that he began too
late. Fingers of fifty are not made for a new skill. It is not, of course,
implied by the words, that he could not write his own name; but that he
did not acquire such a facility as he desired. [1848.]</p></div>

in the general view at the commencement of each volume; the remainder is

preface to this translation is to defend the expediency of rendering books
into English, on account of the general ignorance of Latin. The zeal which
this excellent prince shows for literature is delightful. Let us
endeavour, he says, that all the English youth, especially the children of
those who are free-born, and can educate them, may learn to read English
before they take to any employment. Afterwards such as please may be
instructed in Latin. Before the Danish invasion indeed, he tells us,
churches were well furnished with books; but the priests got little good
from them, being written in a foreign language which they could not
understand.</p></div>

Croyland contained above three hundred volumes, till the unfortunate fire
that destroyed that abbey in 1091. Gale, XV Scriptores, t. i. 93. Such a
library was very extraordinary in the eleventh century, and could not have
been equalled for some ages afterwards. Ingulfus mentions at the same time
a nadir, as he calls it, or planetarium, executed in various metals. This
had been presented to abbot Turketul in the tenth century by a king of
France, and was, I make no doubt, of Arabian or Greek manufacture.</p></div>

Manuscripts written on papyrus, as may be supposed from the fragility of
the material, as well as the difficulty of procuring it, are of extreme
rarity. That in the British Museum, being a charter to a church at Ravenna

Muratori seem never to have seen anything written on papyrus, though they
trace its occasional use down to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_516_516" id="Footnote_516_516"></a><a href="#FNanchor_516_516"><span class="label">[r]</span></a> John Scotus, who, it is almost needless to say, must not be
confounded with the still more famous metaphysician Duns Scotus, lived
under Charles the Bald, in the middle of the ninth century. It admits of
no doubt that John Scotus was, in a literary and philosophical sense, the
most remarkable man of the dark ages; no one else had his boldness, his
subtlety in threading the labyrinths of metaphysical speculations which,
in the west of Europe, had been utterly disregarded. But it is another
question whether he can be reckoned an original writer; those who have
attended most to his treatise De Divisione Natur√¶, the most abstruse of
his works, consider it as the development of an oriental philosophy,
acquired during his residence in Greece, and nearly coinciding with some
of the later Platonism of the Alexandrian school, but with a more
unequivocal tendency to pantheism. This manifests itself in some extracts
which have latterly been made from the treatise De Divisione Natur√¶; but
though Scotus had not the reputation of unblemished orthodoxy, the drift
of his philosophy was not understood in that barbarous period. He might,
indeed, have excited censure by his intrepid preference of reason to
authority. "Authority," he says, "springs from reason, not reason from
authority&mdash;true reason needs not be confirmed by any authority." La
v√©ritable importance historique, says Amp√®re, de Scot Erig√®ne n'est donc
pas dans ses opinions; celles-ci n'ont d'autre int√©r√™t que leur date et le
lieu o√π elles apparaissent. Sans doute, il est piquant et bizarre de voir
ces opinions orientales et alexandrines surgir au IX<sup>e</sup> si√®cle, √† Paris, √†
la cour de Charles le Chauve; mais ce qui n'est pas seulement piquant et
bizarre, ce qui int√©resse le d√©veloppement de l'esprit humain, c'est que
la question ait √©t√© pos√©e, d√®s lors, si nettement entre l'autorit√© et la
raison, et si √©nergiquement r√©solue en faveur de la seconde. En un mot,
par ses id√©es, Scot Erig√®ne est encore un philosophe de l'antiquit√©
Grecque; et par l'ind√©pendance hautement accus√©e de son point de vue
philosophique, il est d√©j√† un d√©vancier de la philosophie moderne. Hist.

Silvester II. died in 1003. Whether he first brought the Arabic numeration
into Europe, as has been commonly said, seems uncertain; it was at least
not much practised for some centuries after his death.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_517_517" id="Footnote_517_517"></a><a href="#FNanchor_517_517"><span class="label">[s]</span></a> Charlemagne had a library at Aix-la-Chapelle, which he
directed to be sold at his death for the benefit of the poor. His son
Louis is said to have collected some books. But this rather confirms, on
the whole, my supposition that, in some periods, no royal or private
libraries existed, since there were not always princes or nobles with the
spirit of Charlemagne, or even Louis the Debonair.
</p><p>
"We possess a catalogue," says M. Amp√®re (quoting d'Achery's Spicilegium,
ii. 310), "of the library in the abbey of St. Riquier, written in 831; it
consists of 256 volumes, some containing several works. Christian writers
are in great majority; but we find also the Eclogues of Virgil, the
Rhetoric of Cicero, the History of Homer, that is, the works ascribed to
Dictys and Dares." Amp√®re, iii. 236. Can anything be lower than this, if
nothing is omitted more valuable than what is mentioned? The Rhetoric of
Cicero was probably the spurious books Ad Herennium. But other libraries
must have been somewhat better furnished than this; else the Latin authors
would have been still less known in the ninth century than they actually
were.
</p><p>
In the gradual progress of learning, a very small number of princes
thought it honourable to collect books. Perhaps no earlier instance can be
mentioned than that of a most respectable man, William III., duke of
Guienne, in the first part of the eleventh century. Fuit dux iste, says a
contemporary writer, a pueritia doctus literis, et satis notitiam
Scripturarum habuit; librorum copiam in palatio suo servavit; et si forte
a frequentia causarum et tumultu vacaret, lectioni per seipsum operam
dabat longioribus noctibus elucubrans in libris, donec somno vinceretur.

casual frays and single combat during war, was unknown before the
sixteenth century. But we find one anecdote which seems to illustrate its
derivation from the judicial combat. The dukes of Lancaster and Brunswick,
having some differences, agreed to decide them by duel before John king of
France. The lists were prepared with the solemnity of a real trial by
battle; but the king interfered to prevent the engagement. Villaret, t.
ix. p. 71. The barbarous practice of wearing swords as a part of domestic
dress, which tended very much to the frequency of duelling, was not
introduced till the latter part of the 15th century. I can only find one
print in Montfaucon's Monuments of the French monarchy where a sword is
worn without armour before the reign of Charles VIII.: though a few, as
early as the reign of Charles VI., have short daggers in their girdles.
The exception is a figure of Charles VII. t. iii. pl. 47.</p></div>

Debonair; a man, as I have noticed in another place, not inferior, as a
legislator, to his father. Ibid. p. 668. "The spirit of party," says a
late writer, "has often accused the church of having devised these
barbarous methods of discovering truth&mdash;the duel and the ordeal; nothing
can be more unjust. Neither one nor the other is derived from
Christianity; they existed long before in the Germanic usages." Amp√®re,
Hist. Litt. de la France, iii. 180. Any one must have been very ignorant
who attributed the invention of ordeals to the church. But during the dark
ages they were always sanctioned. Agobard, from whom M. Amp√®re gives a
quotation, in the reign of Louis the Debonair wrote strongly against them;
but this was the remonstrance of a superior man in an age that was
ill-inclined to hear him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_521_521" id="Footnote_521_521"></a><a href="#FNanchor_521_521"><span class="label">[y]</span></a> Ordeals were not actually abolished in France,
notwithstanding the law of Louis above-mentioned, so late as the eleventh
century (Bouquet, t. xi. p. 430), nor in England till the reign of Henry
III. Some of the stories we read, wherein accused persons have passed
triumphantly through these severe proofs, are perplexing enough: and
perhaps it is safer, as well as easier, to deny than to explain them. For
example, a writer in the Arch√¶ologia (vol. xv. p. 172) has shown that
Emma, queen of Edward the Confessor, did not perform her trial by stepping
<i>between</i>, as Blackstone imagines, but <i>upon</i> nine red-hot ploughshares.
But he seems not aware that the whole story is unsupported by any
contemporary or even respectable testimony. A similar anecdote is related
of Cunegunda, wife of the emperor Henry II., which probably gave rise to
that of Emma. There are, however, medicaments, as is well known, that
protect the skin to a certain degree against the effect of fire. This
phenomenon would pass for miraculous, and form the basis of those
exaggerated stories in monkish books.</p></div>

witnessed in 1211, when a multitude, amounting, as some say, to 90,000,
chiefly composed of children, and commanded by a child, set out for the
purpose of recovering the Holy Land. They came for the most part from
Germany, and reached Genoa without harm. But, finding there an obstacle
which their imperfect knowledge of geography had not anticipated, they
soon dispersed in various directions. Thirty thousand arrived at
Marseilles, where part were murdered, part probably starved, and the rest

Fabliaux, several of the religious tales by which the monks endeavoured to
withdraw the people from romances of chivalry. The following specimens
will abundantly confirm my assertions, which may perhaps appear harsh and
extravagant to the reader.
</p><p>
There was a man whose occupation was highway robbery; but whenever he set
out on any such expedition, he was careful to address a prayer to the
Virgin. Taken at last, he was sentenced to be hanged. While the cord was
round his neck he made his usual prayer, nor was it ineffectual. The
Virgin supported his feet "with her white hands," and thus kept him alive
two days, to the no small surprise of the executioner, who attempted to
complete his work with strokes of a sword. But the same invisible hand
turned aside the weapon, and the executioner was compelled to release his
victim, acknowledging the miracle. The thief retired into a monastery,
which is always the termination of these deliverances.
</p><p>
At the monastery of St. Peter, near Cologne, lived a monk perfectly
dissolute and irreligious, but very devout towards the Apostle. Unluckily
he died suddenly without confession. The fiends came as usual to seize his
soul. St. Peter, vexed at losing so faithful a votary, besought God to
admit the monk into Paradise. His prayer was refused; and though the whole
body of saints, apostles, angels, and martyrs joined at his request to
make interest, it was of no avail. In this extremity he had recourse to
the Mother of God. "Fair lady," he said, "my monk is lost if you do not
interfere for him; but what is impossible for us will be but sport to you,
if you please to assist us. Your Son, if you but speak a word, must yield,
since it is in your power to command him." The Queen Mother assented, and,
followed by all the virgins, moved towards her Son. He who had himself
given the precept, Honour thy father and thy mother, no sooner saw his own
parent approach than he rose to receive her; and taking her by the hand
inquired her wishes. The rest may be easily conjectured. Compare the gross
stupidity, or rather the atrocious impiety of this tale, with the pure
theism of the Arabian Nights, and judge whether the Deity was better
worshipped at Cologne or at Bagdad.
</p><p>
It is unnecessary to multiply instances of this kind. In one tale the
Virgin takes the shape of a nun, who had eloped from the convent, and
performs her duties ten years, till, tired of a libertine life, she
returns unsuspected. This was in consideration of her having never omitted
to say an Ave as she passed the Virgin's image. In another, a gentleman,
in love with a handsome widow, consents, at the instigation of a sorcerer,
to renounce God and the saints, but cannot be persuaded to give up the
Virgin, well knowing that if he kept her his friend he should obtain
pardon through her means. Accordingly she inspired his mistress with so
much passion that he married her within a few days.
</p><p>
These tales, it may be said, were the production of ignorant men, and
circulated among the populace. Certainly they would have excited contempt
and indignation in the more enlightened clergy. But I am concerned with
the general character of religious notions among the people: and for this
it is better to take such popular compositions, adapted to what the laity
already believed, than the writings of comparatively learned and
reflecting men. However, stories of the same cast are frequent in the
monkish historians. Matthew Paris, one of the most respectable of that
class, and no friend to the covetousness or relaxed lives of the
priesthood, tells us of a knight who was on the point of being damned for
frequenting tournaments, but saved by a donation he had formerly made to
the Virgin. p. 290.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_535_535" id="Footnote_535_535"></a><a href="#FNanchor_535_535"><span class="label">[o]</span></a> This hesitation about so important a question is what I
would by no means repeat. Beyond every doubt, the evils of superstition in
the middle ages, though separately considered very serious, are not to be
weighed against the benefits of the religion with which they were so
mingled. The fashion of the eighteenth century, among protestants
especially, was to exaggerate the crimes and follies of medi√¶val
ages&mdash;perhaps I have fallen into it a little too much; in the present we
seem more in danger of extenuating them. We still want an inflexible
impartiality in all that borders on ecclesiastical history, which, I
believe, has never been displayed on an extensive scale. A more
captivating book can hardly be named than the Mores Catholici of Mr.
Digby; and it contains certainly a great deal of truth; but the general
effect is that of a <i>mirage</i>, which confuses and deludes the sight. If
those "ages of faith" were as noble, as pure, as full of human kindness,
as he has delineated them, we have had a bad exchange in the centuries
since the Reformation. And those who gaze at Mr. Digby's enchantments will
do well to consider how they can better escape this consequence than he
has done. Dr. Maitland's Letters on the Dark Ages, and a great deal more
that comes from the pseudo-Anglican or Anglo-catholic press, converge to
the same end; a strong sympathy with the medi√¶val church, a great
indulgence to its errors, and indeed a reluctance to admit them, with a
corresponding estrangement from all that has passed in the last three
centuries. [1848.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_536_536" id="Footnote_536_536"></a><a href="#FNanchor_536_536"><span class="label">[p]</span></a> I am inclined to acquiesce in this general opinion; yet an
account of expenses at Bolton Abbey, about the reign of Edward II.,
published in Whitaker's History of Craven, p. 51, makes a very scanty show
of almsgiving in this opulent monastery. Much, however, was no doubt given
in victuals. But it is a strange error to conceive that English
monasteries before the dissolution fed the indigent part of the nation,
and gave that general relief which the poor-laws are intended to afford.

passage, to whom perhaps I am immediately indebted for it. Hist. Charles
V., vol. i. note 11.
</p><p>
I leave this passage as it stood in former editions. But it is due to
justice that this extract from Eligius should never be quoted in future,
as the translator of Mosheim has induced Robertson and many others, as
well as myself, to do. Dr. Lingard has pointed out that it is a very
imperfect representation of what Eligius has written; for though he has
dwelled on these devotional practices as parts of the definition of a good
Christian, he certainly adds a great deal more to which no one could
object. Yet no one is, in fact, to blame for this misrepresentation,
which, being contained in popular books, has gone forth so widely.
Mosheim, as will appear on referring to him, did not quote the passage as
containing a complete definition of the Christian character. His
translator, Maclaine, mistook this, and wrote, in consequence, the severe
note which Robertson has copied. I have seen the whole passage in
d'Achery's Spicilegium (vol. v. p. 213, 4to. edit.), and can testify that
Dr. Lingard is perfectly correct. Upon the whole, this is a striking proof
how dangerous it is to take any authorities at second-hand.&mdash;<i>Note to
Fourth Edition.</i> Much clamour has been made about the mistake of Maclaine,
which was innocent and not unnatural. It has been commented upon,
particularly by Dr. Arnold, as a proof of the risk we run of
misrepresenting authors by quoting them at second-hand. And this is
perfectly true, and ought to be constantly remembered. But, so long as we
acknowledge the immediate source of our quotation, no censure is due,
since in works of considerable extent this use of secondary authorities is
absolutely indispensable, not to mention the frequent difficulty of
procuring access to original authors [1848.]</p></div>

that of attacking the Jews' houses with stones from Palm Sunday to Easter.

<div class="sidenote">European commerce.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> geographical position of Europe naturally divides its maritime
commerce into two principal regions&mdash;one comprehending those countries
which border on the Baltic, the German and the Atlantic oceans; another,
those situated around the Mediterranean Sea. During the four centuries
which preceded the discovery of America, and especially the two former of
them, this separation was more remarkable than at present, inasmuch as
their intercourse, either by land or sea, was extremely limited. To the
first region belonged the Netherlands, the coasts of France, Germany, and
Scandinavia, and the maritime districts of England. In the second we may
class the provinces of Valencia and Catalonia, those of Provence and
Languedoc, and the whole of Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Woollen manufacture of Flanders.</div>

<p>1. The former, or northern division, was first animated by the woollen
manufacture of Flanders. It is not easy either to discover the early
beginnings of this, or to account for its rapid advancement. The fertility
of that province and its facilities of interior navigation were doubtless
necessary causes; but there must have been some temporary encouragement
from the personal character of its sovereigns, or other accidental
circumstances. Several testimonies to the flourishing condition of Flemish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
manufactures occur in the twelfth century, and some might perhaps
be found even earlier.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
A writer of the thirteenth asserts that all
the world was clothed from English wool wrought in
Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> This,
indeed, is an exaggerated vaunt; but the Flemish stuffs were probably sold
wherever the sea or a navigable river permitted them to be carried.
Cologne was the chief trading city upon the Rhine; and its merchants, who
had been considerable even under the emperor Henry IV., established a
factory at London in 1220. The woollen manufacture, notwithstanding
frequent wars and the impolitic regulations of
magistrates,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
continued to flourish in the Netherlands (for Brabant and Hainault shared it in some
degree with Flanders), until England became not only capable of supplying
her own demand, but a rival in all the marts of Europe. "All Christian
kingdoms, and even the Turks themselves," says an historian of the
sixteenth century, "lamented the desperate war between the Flemish cities
and their count Louis, that broke out in 1380. For at that time Flanders
was a market for the traders of all the world. Merchants from seventeen
kingdoms had their settled domiciles at Bruges, besides strangers from
almost unknown countries who repaired
thither."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
During this war, and on all other occasions, the weavers both of Ghent and Bruges distinguished
themselves by a democratical spirit, the consequence, no doubt, of their
numbers and prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Ghent was one of the largest cities in
Europe, and, in the opinion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
many, the best situated.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> But Bruges,
though in circuit but half the former, was more splendid in its buildings,
and the seat of far more trade; being the great staple both for
Mediterranean and northern
merchandise.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> Antwerp, which early in the
sixteenth century drew away a large part of this commerce from Bruges, was
not considerable in the preceding ages; nor were the towns of Zealand and
Holland much noted except for their fisheries, though those provinces
acquired in the fifteenth century some share of the woollen manufacture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Export of wool from England.</div>

<p>For the first two centuries after the Conquest our English towns, as has
been observed in a different place, made some forward steps towards
improvement, though still very inferior to those of the continent. Their
commerce was almost confined to the exportation of wool, the great staple
commodity of England, upon which, more than any other, in its raw or
manufactured state, our wealth has been founded. A woollen manufacture,
however, indisputably existed under Henry
II.;<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
it is noticed in regulations of Richard I.; and by the importation of woad under John it
may be inferred to have still flourished. The disturbances of the next
reign, perhaps, or the rapid elevation of the Flemish towns, retarded its
growth, though a remarkable law was passed by the Oxford parliament in
1261, prohibiting the export of wool and the importation of cloth. This,
while it shows the deference paid by the discontented barons, who
predominated in that parliament, to their confederates the burghers, was evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
too premature to be enforced. We may infer from it, however,
that cloths were made at home, though not sufficiently for the people's
consumption.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<p>Prohibitions of the same nature, though with a different object, were
frequently imposed on the trade between England and Flanders by Edward I.
and his son. As their political connexions fluctuated, these princes gave
full liberty and settlement to the Flemish merchants, or banished them at
once from the country.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Nothing could be more injurious to England
than this arbitrary vacillation. The Flemings were in every respect our
natural allies; but besides those connexions with France, the constant
enemy of Flanders, into which both the Edwards occasionally fell, a mutual
alienation had been produced by the trade of the former people with
Scotland, a trade too lucrative to be resigned at the king of England's
request.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
An early instance of that conflicting selfishness of
belligerents and neutrals, which was destined to aggravate the animosities
and misfortunes of our own
time.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">English woollen manufacture.</div>

<p>A more prosperous era began with Edward III., the father, as he may almost
be called, of English commerce, a title not indeed more glorious, but by
which he may perhaps claim more of our gratitude than as the hero of
Crecy. In 1331 he took advantage of discontents among the manufacturers of
Flanders to invite them as settlers into his
dominions.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
They brought the finer manufacture of woollen cloths, which had been unknown in
England. The discontents alluded to resulted from the monopolizing spirit
of their corporations, who oppressed all artisans without the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> pale of
their community. The history of corporations brings home to our minds one
cardinal truth, that political institutions have very frequently but a
relative and temporary usefulness, and that what forwarded improvement
during one part of its course may prove to it in time a most pernicious
obstacle. Corporations in England, we may be sure, wanted nothing of their
usual character; and it cost Edward no little trouble to protect his
colonists from the selfishness and from the blind nationality of the
vulgar.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
The emigration of Flemish weavers into England continued
during this reign, and we find it mentioned, at intervals, for more than a
century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increase of English commerce.</div>

<p>Commerce now became, next to liberty, the leading object of parliament.
For the greater part of our statutes from the accession of Edward III.
bear relation to this subject; not always well devised, or liberal, or
consistent, but by no means worse in those respects than such as have been
enacted in subsequent ages. The occupation of a merchant became
honourable; and, notwithstanding the natural jealousy of the two classes,
he was placed, in some measure, on a footing with landed proprietors. By
the statute of apparel, in 37 Edw. III., merchants and artificers who had
five hundred pounds value in goods and chattels might use the same dress
as squires of one hundred pounds a year. And those who were worth more
than this might dress like men of double that estate. Wool was still the
principal article of export and source of revenue. Subsidies granted by
every parliament upon this article were, on account of the scarcity of
money, commonly taken in kind. To prevent evasion of this duty seems to
have been the principle of those multifarious regulations which fix the
staple, or market for wool, in certain towns, either in England, or, more
commonly, on the continent. To these all wool was to be carried, and the
tax was there collected. It is not easy, however, to comprehend the drift
of all the provisions relating to the staple, many of which tend to
benefit foreign at the expense of English merchants. By degrees the
exportation of woollen cloths increased so as to diminish that of the raw
material, but the latter was not absolutely prohibited during the period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
under review;<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
although some restrictions were imposed upon it by
Edward IV. For a much earlier statute, in the 11th of Edward III., making
the exportation of wool a capital felony, was in its terms provisional,
until it should be otherwise ordered by the council; and the king almost
immediately set it aside.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Manufactures of France and Germany.</div>

<p>A manufacturing district, as we see in our own country, sends out, as it
were, suckers into all its neighbourhood. Accordingly, the woollen
manufacture spread from Flanders along the banks of the Rhine and into the
northern provinces of France.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
I am not, however, prepared to trace
its history in these regions. In Germany the privileges conceded by Henry
V. to the free cities, and especially to their artisans, gave a soul to
industry; though the central parts of the empire were, for many reasons,
very ill-calculated for commercial enterprise during the middle
ages.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
But the French towns were never so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> emancipated from arbitrary power
as those of Germany or Flanders; and the evils of exorbitant taxation,
with those produced by the English wars, conspired to retard the advance
of manufactures in France. That of linen made some little progress; but
this work was still, perhaps, chiefly confined to the labour of female
servants.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Baltic trade.</div>

<p>The manufactures of Flanders and England found a market, not only in these
adjacent countries, but in a part of Europe which for many ages had only
been known enough to be dreaded. In the middle of the eleventh century a
native of Bremen, and a writer much superior to most others of his time,
was almost entirely ignorant of the geography of the Baltic; doubting
whether any one had reached Russia by that sea, and reckoning Esthonia and
Courland among its islands.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
But in one hundred years more the
maritime regions of Mecklenburg and Pomerania, inhabited by a tribe of
heathen Sclavonians, were subdued by some German princes; and the Teutonic
order some time afterwards, having conquered Prussia, extended a line of
at least comparative civilization as far as the gulf of Finland. The first
town erected on the coasts of the Baltic was Lubec, which owes its
foundation to Adolphus count of Holstein, in 1140. After several
vicissitudes it became independent of any sovereign but the emperor in the
thirteenth century. Hamburgh and Bremen, upon the other side of the
Cimbric peninsula, emulated the prosperity of Lubec; the former city
purchased independence of its bishop in 1225. A colony from Bremen founded
Riga in Livonia about 1162. The city of Dantzic grew into importance about
the end of the following century. Konigsberg was founded by Ottocar king
of Bohemia in the same age.</p>

<p>But the real importance of these cities is to be dated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> from their famous
union into the Hanseatic confederacy. The origin of this is rather
obscure, but it may certainly be nearly referred in point of time to the
middle of the thirteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
and accounted for by the necessity
of mutual defence, which piracy by sea and pillage by land had taught the
merchants of Germany. The nobles endeavoured to obstruct the formation of
this league, which indeed was in great measure designed to withstand their
exactions. It powerfully maintained the influence which the free imperial
cities were at this time acquiring. Eighty of the most considerable places
constituted the Hanseatic confederacy, divided into four colleges, whereof
Lubec, Cologne, Brunswic, and Dantzic were the leading towns. Lubec held
the chief rank, and became, as it were, the patriarchal see of the league;
whose province it was to preside in all general discussions for
mercantile, political, or military purposes, and to carry them into
execution. The league had four principal factories in foreign parts, at
London, Bruges, Bergen, and Novogorod; endowed by the sovereigns of those
cities with considerable privileges, to which every merchant belonging to
a Hanseatic town was
entitled.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
In England the German guildhall or
factory was established by concession of Henry III.; and in later periods
the Hanse traders were favoured above many others in the capricious
vacillations of our mercantile
policy.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
The English had also their
factories on the Baltic coast as far as Prussia and in the dominions of
Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rapid progress of English trade.</div>

<p>This opening of a northern market powerfully accelerated the growth of our
own commercial opulence, especially after the woollen manufacture had
begun to thrive. From about the middle of the fourteenth century we find
continual evidences of a rapid increase in wealth. Thus, in 1363, Picard,
who had been lord mayor some years before, entertained Edward III. and the
Black Prince, the kings of France, Scotland, and Cyprus, with many of the
nobility, at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
own house in the Vintry, and presented them with
handsome gifts.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
Philpot, another eminent citizen in Richard II.'s
time, when the trade of England was considerably annoyed by privateers,
hired 1000 armed men, and despatched them to sea, where they took fifteen
Spanish vessels with their prizes.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
We find Richard obtaining a great
deal from private merchants and trading towns. In 1379 he got 5000<i>l.</i>
from London, 1000 marks from Bristol, and in proportion from smaller
places. In 1386 London gave 4000<i>l.</i> more, and 10,000 marks in
1397.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
The latter sum was obtained also for the coronation of Henry
VI.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> Nor
were the contributions of individuals contemptible, considering the high
value of money. Hinde, a citizen of London, lent to Henry IV. 2000<i>l.</i> in
1407, and Whittington one half of that sum. The merchants of the staple
advanced 4000<i>l.</i> at the same
time.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
Our commerce continued to be regularly and rapidly progressive during the fifteenth century. The famous
Canynges of Bristol, under Henry VI. and Edward IV., had ships of 900 tons
burthen.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
The trade and even the internal wealth of England reached so
much higher a pitch in the reign of the last-mentioned king than at any
former period, that we may perceive the wars of York and Lancaster to have
produced no very serious effect on national prosperity. Some battles were
doubtless sanguinary; but the loss of lives in battle is soon repaired by
a flourishing nation; and the devastation occasioned by armies was both
partial and transitory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intercourse with the south of Europe.</div>

<p>A commercial intercourse between these northern and southern regions of
Europe began about the early part of the fourteenth century, or, at most,
a little sooner. Until, indeed, the use of the magnet was thoroughly
understood, and a competent skill in marine architecture, as well as
navigation, acquired, the Italian merchants were scarce likely to attempt
a voyage perilous in itself and rendered more formidable by the imaginary
difficulties which had been supposed to attend an expedition beyond the
straits of Hercules. But the English, accustomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
to their own rough seas,
were always more intrepid, and probably more skilful navigators. Though it
was extremely rare, even in the fifteenth century, for an English trading
vessel to appear in the Mediterranean,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
yet a famous military
armament, that destined for the crusade of Richard I., displayed at a very
early time the seamanship of our countrymen. In the reign of Edward II. we
find mention in Rymer's collection of Genoese ships trading to Flanders
and England. His son was very solicitous to preserve the friendship of
that opulent republic; and it is by his letters to his senate, or by royal
orders restoring ships unjustly seized, that we come by a knowledge of
those facts which historians neglect to relate. Pisa shared a little in
this traffic, and Venice more considerably; but Genoa was beyond all
competition at the head of Italian commerce in these seas during the
fourteenth century. In the next her general decline left it more open to
her rival; but I doubt whether Venice ever maintained so strong a
connexion with England. Through London and Bruges, their chief station in
Flanders, the merchants of Italy and of Spain transported oriental produce
to the farthest parts of the north. The inhabitants of the Baltic coast
were stimulated by the desire of precious luxuries which they had never
known; and these wants, though selfish and frivolous, are the means by
which nations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
acquire civilization, and the earth is rendered fruitful of
its produce. As the carriers of this trade the Hanseatic merchants
resident in England and Flanders derived profits through which eventually
of course those countries were enriched. It seems that the Italian vessels
unloaded at the marts of London or Bruges, and that such part of their
cargoes as were intended for a more northern trade came there into the
hands of the German merchants. In the reign of Henry VI. England carried
on a pretty extensive traffic with the countries around the Mediterranean,
for whose commodities her wool and woollen cloths enabled her to pay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commerce of the Mediterranean countries.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Amalfi.</div>

<p>The commerce of the southern division, though it did not, I think, produce
more extensively beneficial effects upon the progress of society, was both
earlier and more splendid than that of England and the neighbouring
countries. Besides Venice, which has been mentioned already, Amalfi kept
up the commercial intercourse of Christendom with the Saracen countries
before the first crusade.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
It was the singular fate of this city to
have filled up the interval between two periods of civilization, in
neither of which she was destined to be distinguished. Scarcely known
before the end of the sixth century, Amalfi ran a brilliant career, as a
free and trading republic, which was checked by the arms of a conqueror in
the middle of the twelfth. Since her subjugation by Roger king of Sicily,
the name of a people who for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
while connected Europe with Asia has
hardly been repeated, except for two discoveries falsely imputed to them,
those of the Pandects and of the compass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pisa, Genoa, Venice.</div>

<p>But the decline of Amalfi was amply compensated to the rest of Italy by
the constant elevation of Pisa, Genoa, and Venice in the twelfth and
ensuing ages. The crusades led immediately to this growing prosperity of
the commercial cities. Besides the profit accruing from so many naval
armaments which they supplied, and the continual passage of private
adventurers in their vessels, they were enabled to open a more extensive
channel of oriental traffic than had hitherto been known. These three
Italian republics enjoyed immunities in the Christian principalities of
Syria; possessing separate quarters in Acre, Tripoli, and other cities,
where they were governed by their own laws and magistrates. Though the
progress of commerce must, from the condition of European industry, have
been slow, it was uninterrupted; and the settlements in Palestine were
becoming important as factories, an use of which Godfrey and Urban little
dreamed, when they were lost through the guilt and imprudence of their
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Villani laments the injury sustained by commerce in
consequence of the capture of Acre, "situated, as it was, on the coast of
the Mediterranean, in the centre of Syria, and, as we might say, of the
habitable world, a haven for all merchandize, both from the East and the
West, which all the nations of the earth frequented for this
trade."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
But the loss was soon retrieved, not perhaps by Pisa and Genoa, but by
Venice, who formed connexions with the Saracen governments, and maintained
her commercial intercourse with Syria and Egypt by their licence, though
subject probably to heavy exactions. Sanuto, a Venetian author at the
beginning of the fourteenth century, has left a curious account of the
Levant trade which his countrymen carried on at that time. Their imports
it is easy to guess, and it appears that timber, brass, tin, and lead, as
well as the precious metals, were exported to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Alexandria, besides oil,
saffron, and some of the productions of Italy, and even wool and woollen
cloths.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
The European side of the account had therefore become respectable.</p>

<p>The commercial cities enjoyed as great privileges at Constantinople as in
Syria, and they bore an eminent part in the vicissitudes of the Eastern
empire. After the capture of Constantinople by the Latin crusaders, the
Venetians, having been concerned in that conquest, became, of course, the
favoured traders under the new dynasty; possessing their own district in
the city, with their magistrate or podest√†, appointed at Venice, and
subject to the parent republic. When the Greeks recovered the seat of
their empire, the Genoese, who, from jealousy of their rivals, had
contributed to that revolution, obtained similar immunities. This powerful
and enterprising state, in the fourteenth century, sometimes the ally,
sometimes the enemy, of the Byzantine court, maintained its independent
settlement at Pera. From thence she spread her sails into the Euxine, and,
planting a colony at Caffa in the Crimea, extended a line of commerce with
the interior regions of Asia, which even the skill and spirit of our own
times has not yet been able to revive.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<p>The French provinces which border on the Mediterranean Sea partook in the
advantages which it offered. Not only Marseilles, whose trade had
continued in a certain degree throughout the worst ages, but Narbonne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Nismes, and especially Montpelier, were distinguished for commercial
prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
A still greater activity prevailed in Catalonia. From the
middle of the thirteenth century (for we need not trace the rudiments of
its history) Barcelona began to emulate the Italian cities in both the
branches of naval energy, war and commerce. Engaged in frequent and severe
hostilities with Genoa, and sometimes with Constantinople, while their
vessels traded to every part of the Mediterranean, and even of the English
Channel, the Catalans might justly be reckoned among the first of maritime
nations. The commerce of Barcelona has never since attained so great a
height as in the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Their manufactures.</div>

<p>The introduction of a silk manufacture at Palermo, by Roger Guiscard in
1148, gave perhaps the earliest impulse to the industry of Italy. Nearly
about the same time the Genoese plundered two Moorish cities of Spain,
from which they derived the same art. In the next age this became a staple
manufacture of the Lombard and Tuscan republics, and the cultivation of
mulberries was enforced by their
laws.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Woollen stuffs, though the trade was perhaps less conspicuous than that of Flanders, and though many
of the coarser kinds were imported from thence, employed a multitude of
workmen in Italy, Catalonia, and the south of
France.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
Among the trading companies into which the middling ranks were distributed, those
concerned in silk and woollens were most numerous and
honourable.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Invention of the mariner's compass.</div>

<p>A property of a natural substance, long overlooked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> even though it
attracted observation by a different peculiarity, has influenced by its
accidental discovery the fortunes of mankind more than all the deductions
of philosophy. It is, perhaps, impossible to ascertain the epoch when the
polarity of the magnet was first known in Europe. The common opinion,
which ascribes its discovery to a citizen of Amalfi in the fourteenth
century, is undoubtedly erroneous. Guiot de Provins, a French poet, who
lived about the year 1200, or, at the latest, under St. Louis, describes
it in the most unequivocal language. James de Vitry, a bishop in
Palestine, before the middle of the thirteenth century, and Guido
Guinizzelli, an Italian poet of the same time, are equally explicit. The
French, as well as Italians, claim the discovery as their own; but whether
it were due to either of these nations, or rather learned from their
intercourse with the Saracens, is not easily to be
ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> For
some time, perhaps, even this wonderful improvement in the art of
navigation might not be universally adopted by vessels sailing within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> the
Mediterranean, and accustomed to their old system of observations. But
when it became more established, it naturally inspired a more fearless
spirit of adventure. It was not, as has been mentioned, till the beginning
of the fourteenth century that the Genoese and other nations around that
inland sea steered into the Atlantic Ocean towards England and Flanders.
This intercourse with the northern countries enlivened their trade with
the Levant by the exchange of productions which Spain and Italy do not
supply, and enriched the merchants by means of whose capital the exports
of London and of Alexandria were conveyed into each other's harbours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maritime laws.</div>

<p>The usual risks of navigation, and those incident to commercial adventure,
produce a variety of questions in every system of jurisprudence, which,
though always to be determined, as far as possible, by principles of
natural justice, must in many cases depend upon established customs. These
customs of maritime law were anciently reduced into a code by the
Rhodians, and the Roman emperors preserved or reformed the constitutions
of that republic. It would be hard to say how far the tradition of this
early jurisprudence survived the decline of commerce in the darker ages;
but after it began to recover itself, necessity suggested, or recollection
prompted, a scheme of regulations resembling in some degree, but much more
enlarged than those of antiquity. This was formed into a written code, Il
Consolato del Mare, not much earlier, probably, than the middle of the
thirteenth century; and its promulgation seems rather to have proceeded
from the citizens of Barcelona than from those of Pisa or Venice, who have
also claimed to be the first legislators of the
sea.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> Besides
regulations simply mercantile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
this system has defined the mutual rights
of neutral and belligerent vessels, and thus laid the basis of the
positive law of nations in its most important and disputed cases. The king
of France and count of Provence solemnly acceded to this maritime code,
which hence acquired a binding force within the Mediterranean Sea; and in
most respects the law merchant of Europe is at present conformable to its
provisions. A set of regulations, chiefly borrowed from the Consolato, was
compiled in France under the reign of Louis IX., and prevailed in their
own country. These have been denominated the laws of Oleron, from an idle
story that they were enacted by Richard I., while his expedition to the
Holy Land lay at anchor in that
island.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
Nor was the north without its peculiar code of maritime jurisprudence; namely, the Ordinances of Wisbuy,
a town in the isle of Gothland, principally compiled from those of Oleron,
before the year 1400, by which the Baltic traders were
governed.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Frequency of piracy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Law of reprisals.</div>

<p>There was abundant reason for establishing among maritime nations some
theory of mutual rights, and for securing the redress of injuries, as far
as possible, by means of acknowledged tribunals. In that state of
barbarous anarchy which so long resisted the coercive authority of civil
magistrates, the sea held out even more temptation and more impunity than
the land; and when the laws had regained their sovereignty, and neither
robbery nor private warfare was any longer tolerated, there remained that
great common of mankind, unclaimed by any king, and the liberty of the sea
was another name for the security of plunderers. A pirate, in a well-armed
quick-sailing vessel, must feel, I suppose, the enjoyments of his
exemption from control more exquisitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
than any other freebooter; and
darting along the bosom of the ocean, under the impartial radiance of the
heavens, may deride the dark concealments and hurried flights of the
forest robber. His occupation is, indeed, extinguished by the civilization
of later ages, or confined to distant climates. But in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries, a rich vessel was never secure from attack; and
neither restitution nor punishment of the criminals was to be obtained
from governments who sometimes feared the plunderer and sometimes connived
at the offence.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
Mere piracy, however, was not the only danger. The
maritime towns of Flanders, France, and England, like the free republics
of Italy, prosecuted their own quarrels by arms, without asking the leave
of their respective sovereigns. This practice, exactly analogous to that
of private war in the feudal system, more than once involved the kings of
France and England in
hostility.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
But where the quarrel did not
proceed to such a length as absolutely to engage two opposite towns, a
modification of this ancient right of revenge formed part of the regular
law of nations, under the name of reprisals. Whoever was plundered or
injured by the inhabitant of another town obtained authority from his own
magistrates to seize the property of any other person belonging to it,
until his loss should be compensated. This law of reprisal was not
confined to maritime places; it prevailed in Lombardy, and probably in the
German cities. Thus, if a citizen of Modena was robbed by a Bolognese, he
complained to the magistrates of the former city, who represented the case
to those of Bologna, demanding redress. If this were not immediately
granted, letters of reprisals were issued to plunder the territory of
Bologna till the injured party should be reimbursed by sale of the
spoil.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
In the laws of Marseilles it is declared, "If a foreigner take anything from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
a citizen of Marseilles, and he who has jurisdiction over
the said debtor or unjust taker does not cause right to be done in the
same, the rector or consuls, at the petition of the said citizen, shall
grant him reprisals upon all the goods of the said debtor or unjust taker,
and also upon the goods of others who are under the jurisdiction of him
who ought to do justice, and would not, to the said citizen of
Marseilles."<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Edward III. remonstrates, in an instrument published by
Rymer, against letters of marque granted by the king of Aragon to one
Berenger de la Tone, who had been robbed by an English pirate of 2000<i>l.</i>,
alleging that, inasmuch as he had always been ready to give redress to the
party, it seemed to his counsellors that there was no just cause for
reprisals upon the king's or his subjects'
property.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
This passage is so far curious as it asserts the existence of a customary law of nations,
the knowledge of which was already a sort of learning. Sir E. Coke speaks
of this right of private reprisals as if it still
existed;<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> and, in
fact, there are instances of granting such letters as late as the reign of
Charles I.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liability of aliens for each other's debts.</div>

<p>A practice, founded on the same principles as reprisal, though rather less
violent, was that of attaching the goods or persons of resident foreigners
for the debts of their countrymen. This indeed, in England, was not
confined to foreigners until the statute of Westminster I. c. 23, which
enacts that "no stranger who is of this realm shall be distrained in any
town or market for a debt wherein he is neither principal nor surety."
Henry III. had previously granted a charter to the burgesses of Lubec,
that they should "not be arrested for the debt of any of their countrymen,
unless the magistrates of Lubec neglected to compel
payment."<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> But by
a variety of grants from Edward II. the privileges of English subjects
under the statute of Westminster were extended to most foreign
nations.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
This unjust responsibility had not been confined to civil
cases. One of a company of Italian merchants, the Spini, having killed a
man, the officers of justice seized the bodies and effects of all the

<div class="sidenote">and high rate of interest.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Money dealings of the Jews.</div>

<p>If under all these obstacles, whether created by barbarous manners, by
national prejudice, or by the fraudulent and arbitrary measures of
princes, the merchants of different countries became so opulent as almost
to rival the ancient nobility, it must be ascribed to the greatness of
their commercial profits. The trading companies possessed either a
positive or a virtual monopoly, and held the keys of those eastern
regions, for the luxuries of which the progressive refinement of manners
produced an increasing demand. It is not easy to determine the average
rate of profit;<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
but we know that the interest of money was
exceedingly high throughout the middle ages. At Verona, in 1228, it was
fixed by law at twelve and a half per cent.; at Modena, in 1270, it seems
to have been as high as twenty.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
The republic of Genoa, towards the
end of the fourteenth century, when Italy had grown wealthy, paid only
from seven to ten per cent. to her
creditors.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
But in France and England the rate was far more oppressive. An ordinance of Philip the Fair,
in 1311, allows twenty per cent. after the first year of the
loan.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
Under Henry III., according to Matthew Paris, the debtor paid ten per
cent. every two months;<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
but this is absolutely incredible as a
general practice. This was not merely owing to scarcity of money, but to
the discouragement which a strange prejudice opposed, to one of the most
useful and legitimate branches of commerce. Usury, or lending money for
profit, was treated as a crime by the theologians of the middle ages; and
though the superstition has been eradicated, some part of the prejudice
remains in our legislation. This trade in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
money, and indeed a great part
of inland trade in general, had originally fallen to the Jews, who were
noted for their usury so early as the sixth
century.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
For several subsequent ages they continued to employ their capital and industry to the
same advantage, with little molestation from the clergy, who always
tolerated their avowed and national infidelity, and often with some
encouragement from princes. In the twelfth century we find them not only
possessed of landed property in Languedoc, and cultivating the studies of
medicine and Rabbinical literature in their own academy at Montpelier,
under the protection of the count of Toulouse, but invested with civil
offices.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Raymond Roger, viscount of Carcasonne, directs a writ "to
his bailiffs, Christian and Jewish."<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
It was one of the conditions
imposed by the church on the count of Toulouse, that he should allow no
Jews to possess magistracy in his
dominions.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
But in Spain they were placed by some of the municipal laws on the footing of Christians, with
respect to the composition for their lives, and seem in no other European
country to have been so numerous or
considerable.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> The diligence and
expertness of this people in all pecuniary dealings recommended them to
princes who were solicitous about the improvement of their revenue. We
find an article in the general charter of privileges granted by Peter III.
of Aragon, in 1283, that no Jew should hold the office of a bayle or
judge. And two kings of Castile, Alonzo XI. and Peter the Cruel, incurred
much odium by employing Jewish ministers in their treasury. But, in other
parts of Europe, their condition had, before that time, begun to change
for the worse&mdash;partly from the fanatical spirit of the crusades, which
prompted the populace to massacre, and partly from the jealousy which
their opulence excited. Kings, in order to gain money and popularity at
once, abolished the debts due to the children of Israel, except a part
which they retained as the price of their bounty. One is at a loss to
conceive the process of reasoning in an ordinance of St. Louis, where,
"for the salvation of his own soul and those of his ancestors, he releases to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
Christians a third part of what was owing by them to
Jews."<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
Not content with such edicts, the kings of France sometimes banished the
whole nation from their dominions, seizing their effects at the same time;
and a season of alternative severity and toleration continued till, under
Charles VI., they were finally expelled from the kingdom, where they never
afterwards possessed any legal
settlement.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
They were expelled from
England under Edward I., and never obtained any legal permission to reside
till the time of Cromwell. This decline of the Jews was owing to the
transference of their trade in money to other hands. In the early part of
the thirteenth century the merchants of Lombardy and of the south of
France<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
took up the business of remitting money by bills of
exchange,<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
and of making profit upon loans. The utility of this was
found so great, especially by the Italian clergy, who thus in an easy
manner drew the income of their transalpine benefices, that in spite of
much obloquy, the Lombard usurers established themselves in every country,
and the general progress of commerce wore off the bigotry that had
obstructed their reception. A distinction was made between moderate and
exorbitant interest; and though the casuists did not acquiesce in this
legal regulation, yet it satisfied, even in superstitious times, the
consciences of provident
traders.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
The Italian bankers were frequently
allowed to farm the customs in England, as a security perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> for loans
which, were not very punctually
repaid.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
In 1345 the Bardi at Florence, the greatest company in Italy, became bankrupt, Edward III.
owing them, in principal and interest, 900,000 gold florins. Another, the
Peruzzi, failed at the same time, being creditors to Edward for 600,000
florins. The king of Sicily owed 100,000 florins to each of these bankers.
Their failure involved, of course, a multitude of Florentine citizens, and
was a heavy misfortune to the
state.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Banks of Genoa and others.</div>

<p>The earliest bank of deposit, instituted for the accommodation of private
merchants, is said to have been that of Barcelona,
in 1401.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
The banks of Venice and Genoa were of a different description. Although the former
of these two has the advantage of greater antiquity, having been formed,
as we are told, in the twelfth century, yet its early history is not so
clear as that of Genoa, nor its political importance so remarkable,
however similar might be its origin.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
During the wars of Genoa in the
fourteenth century, she had borrowed large sums of private citizens, to
whom the revenues were pledged for repayment. The republic of Florence had
set a recent, though not a very encouraging example of a public loan, to
defray the expense of her war against Mastino della Scala, in 1336. The
chief mercantile firms, as well as individual citizens, furnished money on
an assignment of the taxes, receiving fifteen per cent. interest, which
appears to have been above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
rate of private usury.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> The state was
not unreasonably considered a worse debtor than some of her citizens, for
in a few years these loans were consolidated into a general fund, or
<i>monte</i>, with some deduction from the capital and a great diminution of
interest; so that an original debt of one hundred florins sold only for
twenty-five.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
But I have not found that these creditors formed at
Florence a corporate body, or took any part, as such, in the affairs of
the republic. The case was different at Genoa. As a security, at least,
for their interest, the subscribers to public loans were permitted to
receive the produce of the taxes by their own collectors, paying the
excess into the treasury. The number and distinct classes of these
subscribers becoming at length inconvenient, they were formed, about the
year 1407, into a single corporation, called the bank of St. George, which
was from that time the sole national creditor and mortgagee. The
government of this was intrusted to eight protectors. It soon became
almost independent of the state. Every senator, on his admission, swore to
maintain the privileges of the bank, which were confirmed by the pope, and
even by the emperor. The bank interposed its advice in every measure of
government, and generally, as is admitted, to the public advantage. It
equipped armaments at its own expense, one of which subdued the island of
Corsica; and this acquisition, like those of our great Indian corporation,
was long subject to a company of merchants, without any interference of
the mother country.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Increase of domestic expenditure.</div>

<p>The increasing wealth of Europe, whether derived from internal improvement
or foreign commerce, displayed itself in more expensive consumption, and
greater refinements of domestic life. But these effects were for a long
time very gradual, each generation making a few steps in the progress,
which are hardly discernible except by an attentive inquirer. It is not
till the latter half of the thirteenth century that an accelerated impulse
appears to be given to society. The just government and suppression of
disorder under St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Louis, and the peaceful temper of his brother Alfonso,
count of Toulouse and Poitou, gave France leisure to avail herself of her
admirable fertility. England, that to a soil not greatly inferior to that
of France united the inestimable advantage of an insular position, and was
invigorated, above all, by her free constitution and the steady
industriousness of her people, rose with a pretty uniform motion from the
time of Edward I. Italy, though the better days of freedom had passed away
in most of her republics, made a rapid transition from simplicity to
refinement. "In those times," says a writer about the year 1300, speaking
of the age of Frederic II., "the manners of the Italians were rude. A man
and his wife ate off the same plate. There was no wooden-handled knives,
nor more than one or two drinking cups in a house. Candles of wax or
tallow were unknown; a servant held a torch during supper. The clothes of
men were of leather unlined: scarcely any gold or silver was seen on their
dress. The common people ate flesh but three times a week, and kept their
cold meat for supper. Many did not drink wine in summer. A small stock of
corn seemed riches. The portions of women were small; their dress, even
after marriage, was simple. The pride of men was to be well provided with
arms and horses; that of the nobility to have lofty towers, of which all
the cities in Italy were full. But now frugality has been changed for
sumptuousness; every thing exquisite is sought after in dress; gold,
silver, pearls, silks, and rich furs. Foreign wines and rich meats are
required. Hence usury, rapine, fraud, tyranny,"
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
This passage is supported by other testimonies nearly of the same time. The conquest of
Naples by Charles of Anjou in 1266 seems to have been the epoch of
increasing luxury throughout Italy. His Proven√ßal knights with their
plumed helmets and golden collars, the chariot of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> queen covered with
blue velvet and sprinkled with lilies of gold, astonished the citizens of
Naples.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
Provence had enjoyed a long tranquillity, the natural source
of luxurious magnificence; and Italy, now liberated from the yoke of the
empire, soon reaped the same fruit of a condition more easy and peaceful
than had been her lot for several ages. Dante speaks of the change of
manners at Florence from simplicity and virtue to refinement and
dissoluteness, in terms very nearly similar to those quoted
above.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[o]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the fourteenth century there continued to be a rapid but steady
progression in England of what we may denominate elegance, improvement, or
luxury; and if this was for a time suspended in France, it must be
ascribed to the unusual calamities which befell that country under Philip
of Valois and his son. Just before the breaking out of the English wars an
excessive fondness for dress is said to have distinguished not only the
higher ranks, but the burghers, whose foolish emulation at least indicates
their easy circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
Modes of dress hardly perhaps deserve our
notice on their own account; yet so far as their universal prevalence was
a symptom of diffused wealth, we should not overlook either the invectives
bestowed by the clergy on the fantastic extravagances of fashion, or the
sumptuary laws by which it was endeavoured to restrain them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sumptuary laws.</div>

<p>The principle of sumptuary laws was partly derived from the small
republics of antiquity, which might perhaps require that security for
public spirit and equal rights&mdash;partly from the austere and injudicious
theory of religion disseminated by the clergy. These prejudices united to
render all increase of general comforts odious under the name of luxury;
and a third motive more powerful than either, the jealousy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> which the
great regard anything like imitation in those beneath them, co-operated to
produce a sort of restrictive code in the laws of Europe. Some of these
regulations are more ancient; but the chief part were enacted, both in
France and England, during the fourteenth century, extending to expenses
of the table as well as apparel. The first statute of this description in
our own country was, however, repealed the next
year;<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
and subsequent provisions were entirely disregarded by a nation which valued liberty and
commerce too much to obey laws conceived in a spirit hostile to both. Laws
indeed designed by those governments to restrain the extravagance of their
subjects may well justify the severe indignation which Adam Smith has
poured upon all such interference with private expenditure. The kings of
France and England were undoubtedly more egregious spendthrifts than any
others in their dominions; and contributed far more by their love of
pageantry to excite a taste for dissipation in their people than by their
ordinances to repress it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Domestic manners of Italy.</div>

<p>Mussus, an historian of Placentia, has left a pretty copious account of
the prevailing manners among his countrymen about 1388, and expressly
contrasts their more luxurious living with the style of their ancestors
seventy years before, when, as we have seen, they had already made
considerable steps towards refinement. This passage is highly interesting,
because it shows the regular tenor of domestic economy in an Italian city
rather than a mere display of individual magnificence, as in most of the
facts collected by our own and the French antiquaries. But it is much too
long for insertion in this
place.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
No other country, perhaps, could
exhibit so fair a picture of middle life: in France the burghers, and even
the inferior gentry, were for the most part in a state of poverty at this
period, which they concealed by an affectation of ornament; while our
English yeomanry and tradesmen were more anxious to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> invigorate their
bodies by a generous diet than to dwell in well furnished houses, or to
find comfort in cleanliness and
elegance.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
The German cities, however, had acquired with liberty the spirit of improvement and industry. From the
time that Henry V. admitted their artisans to the privileges of free
burghers they became more and more
prosperous;<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> while the steadiness
and frugality of the German character compensated for some disadvantages
arising out of their inland situation. Spire, Nuremberg, Ratisbon, and
Augsburg were not indeed like the rich markets of London and Bruges, nor
could their burghers rival the princely merchants of Italy; but they
enjoyed the blessings of competence diffused over a large class of
industrious freemen, and in the fifteenth century one of the politest
Italians could extol their splendid and well furnished dwellings, their
rich apparel, their easy and affluent mode of living, the security of
their rights and just equality of their
laws.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil architecture.</div>

<p>No chapter in the history of national manners would illustrate so well, if
duly executed, the progress of social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> life as that dedicated to domestic
architecture. The fashions of dress and of amusements are generally
capricious and irreducible to rule; but every change in the dwellings of
mankind, from the rudest wooden cabin to the stately mansion, has been
dictated by some principle of convenience, neatness, comfort, or
magnificence. Yet this most interesting field of research has been less
beaten by our antiquaries than others comparatively barren. I do not
pretend to a complete knowledge of what has been written by these learned
inquirers; but I can only name one book in which the civil architecture of
our ancestors has been sketched, loosely indeed, but with a superior hand,
and another in which it is partially noticed. I mean by the first a
chapter in the Appendix to Dr. Whitaker's History of Whalley; and by the
second Mr. King's Essays on Ancient Castles in the
Arch√¶ologia.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> Of
these I shall make free use in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>The most ancient buildings which we can trace in this island, after the
departure of the Romans, were circular towers of no great size, whereof
many remain in Scotland, erected either on a natural eminence or on an
artificial mound of earth. Such are Conisborough Castle in Yorkshire and
Castleton in Derbyshire, built perhaps, according to Mr. King, before the
Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
To the lower chambers of those gloomy keeps there was no
admission of light or air except through long narrow loop-holes and an
aperture in the roof. Regular windows were made in the upper apartments.
Were it not for the vast thickness of the walls, and some marks of
attention both to convenience and decoration in these structures, we might
be induced to consider them as rather intended for security
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> during the
transient inroad of an enemy than for a chieftain's usual residence. They
bear a close resemblance, except by their circular form and more insulated
situation, to the peels, or square towers of three or four stories, which
are still found contiguous to ancient mansion-houses, themselves far more
ancient, in the northern
counties,<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
and seem to have been designed for places of refuge.</p>

<p>In course of time, the barons who owned these castles began to covet a
more comfortable dwelling. The keep was either much enlarged, or
altogether relinquished as a place of residence except in time of siege;
while more convenient apartments were sometimes erected in the tower of
entrance, over the great gateway, which led to the inner ballium or
court-yard. Thus at Tunbridge Castle, this part of which is referred by
Mr. King to the beginning of the thirteenth century, there was a room,
twenty-eight feet by sixteen, on each side of the gateway; another above
of the same dimensions, with an intermediate room over the entrance; and
one large apartment on the second floor occupying the whole space, and
intended for state. The windows in this class of castles were still little
better than loop-holes on the basement story, but in the upper rooms often
large and beautifully ornamented, though always looking inwards to the
court. Edward I. introduced a more splendid and convenient style of
castles, containing many habitable towers, with communicating apartments.
Conway and Carnarvon will be familiar examples. The next innovation was
the castle-palace&mdash;of which Windsor, if not quite the earliest, is the
most magnificent instance. Alnwick, Naworth, Harewood, Spofforth,
Kenilworth, and Warwick, were all built upon this scheme during the
fourteenth century, but subsequent enlargements have rendered caution
necessary to distinguish their original remains. "The odd mixture," says
Mr. King, "of convenience and magnificence with cautious designs for
protection and defence, and with the inconveniences of the former confined
plan of a close fortress, is very striking." The provisions for defence
became now, however, little more than nugatory; large arched windows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
like those of cathedrals, were introduced into halls, and this change in
architecture manifestly bears witness to the cessation of baronial wars
and the increasing love of splendour in the reign of Edward III.</p>

<p>To these succeeded the castellated houses of the fifteenth century, such
as Herstmonceux in Sussex, Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, and the older part
of Knowle in Kent.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
They resembled fortified castles in their strong
gateways, their turrets and battlements, to erect which a royal licence
was necessary; but their defensive strength could only have availed
against a sudden affray or attempt at forcible dispossession. They were
always built round one or two court-yards, the circumference of the first,
when they were two, being occupied by the offices and servants' rooms,
that of the second by the state-apartments. Regular quadrangular houses,
not castellated, were sometimes built during the same age, and under Henry
VII. became universal in the superior style of domestic
architecture.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
The quadrangular form, as well from security and convenience as from
imitation of conventual houses, which were always constructed upon that
model, was generally preferred&mdash;even where the dwelling-house, as indeed
was usual, only took up one side of the enclosure, and the remaining three
contained the offices, stables, and farm-buildings, with walls of
communication. Several very old parsonages appear to have been built in
this manner.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
It is, however, not very easy to discover any large
fragments of houses inhabited by the gentry before the reign, at soonest,
of Edward III., or even to trace them by engravings in the older
topographical works, not only from the dilapidations of time, but because
very few considerable mansions had been erected by that class. A great
part of England affords no stone fit for building, and the vast though
unfortunately not inexhaustible resources of her oak forests were easily
applied to less durable and magnificent structures. A frame of massive
timber, independent of walls and resembling the inverted hull of a large
ship, formed the skeleton, as it were, of an ancient hall&mdash;the principal
beams springing from the ground naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span> curved, and forming a Gothic
arch overhead. The intervals of these were filled up with horizontal
planks; but in the earlier buildings, at least in some districts, no part
of the walls was of stone.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
Stone houses are, however, mentioned as
belonging to citizens of London, even in the reign of Henry
II.;<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> and,
though not often perhaps regularly hewn stones, yet those scattered over
the soil or dug from flint quarries, bound together with a very strong and
durable cement, were employed in the construction of manerial houses,
especially in the western counties and other parts where that material is
easily procured.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
Gradually even in timber buildings the intervals of
the main beams, which now became perpendicular, not throwing off their
curved springers till they reached a considerable height, were occupied by
stone walls, or where stone was expensive, by mortar or plaster,
intersected by horizontal or diagonal beams, grooved into the principal
piers.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
This mode of building continued for a long time, and is still
familiar to our eyes in the older streets of the metropolis and other
towns, and in many parts of the
country.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
Early in the fourteenth century the art of building with brick, which had been lost since the
Roman dominion, was introduced probably from Flanders. Though several
edifices of that age are constructed with this material, it did not come
into general use till the reign of Henry
VI.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
Many considerable houses as well as public buildings were erected with bricks during his reign and
that of Edward IV., chiefly in the eastern counties, where the deficiency
of stone was most experienced. Few, if any, brick mansion-houses of the
fifteenth century exist, except in a dilapidated state; but Queen's
College and Clare Hall at Cambridge, and part of Eton College, are
subsisting witnesses to the durability of the material as it was then
employed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meanness of ordinary mansion-houses.</div>

<p>It is an error to suppose that the English gentry were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> lodged in stately
or even in well-sized houses. Generally speaking, their dwellings were
almost as inferior to those of their descendants in capacity as they were
in convenience. The usual arrangement consisted of an entrance-passage
running through the house, with a hall on one side, a parlour beyond, and
one or two chambers above, and on the opposite side, a kitchen, pantry,
and other offices.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Such was the ordinary manor-house of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, as appears not only from the documents and
engravings, but as to the latter period, from the buildings themselves,
sometimes, though not very frequently, occupied by families of
consideration, more often converted into farm-houses or distinct
tenements. Larger structures were erected by men of great estates during
the reigns of Henry IV. and Edward IV.; but very few can be traced higher;
and such has been the effect of time, still more through the advance or
decline of families and the progress of architectural improvement, than
the natural decay of these buildings, that I should conceive it difficult
to name a house in England, still inhabited by a gentleman and not
belonging to the order of castles, the principal apartments of which are
older than the reign of Henry VII. The instances at least must be
extremely few.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<p>France by no means appears to have made a greater progress than our own
country in domestic architecture. Except fortified castles, I do not find
in the work of a very miscellaneous but apparently diligent
writer,<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
any considerable dwellings mentioned before the reign of Charles VII., and
very few of so early a
date.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> Jacques
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span> C&oelig;ur, a famous merchant
unjustly persecuted by that prince, had a handsome house at Paris, as well
as another at Bourges.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
It is obvious that the long calamities which
France endured before the expulsion of the English must have retarded this
eminent branch of national improvement.</p>

<p>Even in Italy, where from the size of her cities and social refinements of
her inhabitants, greater elegance and splendour in building were justly to
be expected, the domestic architecture of the middle ages did not attain
any perfection. In several towns the houses were covered with thatch, and
suffered consequently from destructive fires. Costanzo, a Neapolitan
historian near the end of the sixteenth century, remarks the change of
manners that had occurred since the reign of Joanna II. one hundred and
fifty years before. The great families under the queen expended all their
wealth on their retainers, and placed their chief pride in bringing them
into the field. They were ill lodged, not sumptuously clothed, nor
luxurious in their tables. The house of Caracciolo, high steward of that
princess, one of the most powerful subjects that ever existed, having
fallen into the hands of persons incomparably below his station, had been
enlarged by them, as insufficient for their
accommodation.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> If such
were the case in the city of Naples so late as the beginning of the
fifteenth century, we may guess how mean were the habitations in less
polished parts of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Invention of chimneys and glass windows.</div>

<p>The two most essential improvements in architecture during this period,
one of which had been missed by the sagacity of Greece and Rome, were
chimneys and glass windows. Nothing apparently can be more simple than the former;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
yet the wisdom of ancient times had been content to let the smoke
escape by an aperture in the centre of the roof; and a discovery, of which
Vitruvius had not a glimpse, was made, perhaps in this country, by some
forgotten semi-barbarian. About the middle of the fourteenth century the
use of chimneys is distinctly mentioned in England and in Italy; but they
are found in several of our castles which bear a much older
date.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
This country seems to have lost very early the art of making glass, which
was preserved in France, whence artificers were brought into England to
furnish the windows in some new churches in the seventh
century.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[s]</a> It
is said that in the reign of Henry III. a few ecclesiastical buildings had
glazed windows.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
Suger, however, a century before, had adorned his
great work, the abbey of St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Denis, with windows, not only glazed but
painted;<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
and I presume that other churches of the same class, both in
France and England, especially after the lancet-shaped window had yielded
to one of ampler dimensions, were generally decorated in a similar manner.
Yet glass is said not to have been employed in the domestic architecture
of France before the fourteenth
century;<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> and its introduction into
England was probably by no means earlier. Nor indeed did it come into
general use during the period of the middle ages. Glazed windows were
considered as moveable furniture, and probably bore a high price. When the
earls of Northumberland, as late as the reign of Elizabeth, left Alnwick
Castle, the windows were taken out of their frames, and carefully laid
by.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Furniture of houses.</div>

<p>But if the domestic buildings of the fifteenth century would not seem very
spacious or convenient at present, far less would this luxurious
generation be content with their internal accommodations. A gentleman's
house containing three or four beds was extraordinarily well provided; few
probably had more than two. The walls were commonly bare, without wainscot
or even plaster; except that some great houses were furnished with
hangings, and that perhaps hardly so soon as the reign of Edward IV. It is
unnecessary to add, that neither libraries of books nor pictures could
have found a place among furniture. Silver plate was very rare, and hardly
used for the table. A few inventories of furniture that still remain
exhibit a miserable
deficiency.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
And this was incomparably greater in
private gentlemen's houses than among citizens, and especially foreign
merchants. We have an inventory of the goods belonging to Contarini, a
rich Venetian trader, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
his house in St. Botolph's Lane, <small>A.D.</small> 1481.
There appear to have been no less than ten beds, and glass windows are
especially noticed as moveable furniture. No mention however is made of
chairs or looking-glasses.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
If we compare this account, however
trifling in our estimation, with a similar inventory of furniture in
Skipton Castle, the great honour of the earls of Cumberland, and among the
most splendid mansions of the north, not at the same period, for I have
not found any inventory of a nobleman's furniture so ancient, but in 1572,
after almost a century of continual improvement, we shall be astonished at
the inferior provision of the baronial residence. There were not more than
seven or eight beds in this great castle; nor had any of the chambers
either chairs, glasses, or
carpets.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
It is in this sense, probably,
that we must understand √Üneas Sylvius, if he meant any thing more than to
express a traveller's discontent, when he declares that the kings of
Scotland would rejoice to be as well lodged as the second class of
citizens at Nuremberg.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
Few burghers of that town had mansions, I
presume, equal to the palaces of Dumferlin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> or Stirling, but it is not
unlikely that they were better furnished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Farm-houses and cottages.</div>

<p>In the construction of farm-houses and cottages, especially the latter,
there have probably been fewer changes; and those it would be more
difficult to follow. No building of this class can be supposed to exist of
the antiquity to which the present work is confined; and I do not know
that we have any document as to the inferior architecture of England, so
valuable as one which M. de Paulmy has quoted for that of France, though
perhaps more strictly applicable to Italy, an illuminated manuscript of
the fourteenth century, being a translation of Crescentio's work on
agriculture, illustrating the customs, and, among other things, the
habitations of the agricultural class. According to Paulmy, there is no
other difference between an ancient and a modern farm-house than arises
from the introduction of tiled
roofs.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
In the original work of Crescentio, a native of Bologna, who composed this treatise on rural
affairs about the year 1300, an Italian farm-house, when built at least
according to his plan, appears to have been commodious both in size and
arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Cottages in England seem to have generally consisted of
a single room without division of stories. Chimneys were unknown in such
dwellings till the early part of Elizabeth's reign, when a very rapid and
sensible improvement took place in the comforts of our yeomanry and
cottagers.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical architecture.</div>

<p>It must be remembered that I have introduced this disadvantageous
representation of civil architecture, as a proof of general poverty and
backwardness in the refinements of life. Considered in its higher
departments, that art is the principal boast of the middle ages. The
common buildings, especially those of a public kind, were constructed with
skill and attention to durability. The castellated style displays these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
qualities in great perfection; the means are well adapted to their
objects, and its imposing grandeur, though chiefly resulting no doubt from
massiveness and historical association, sometimes indicates a degree of
architectural genius in the conception. But the most remarkable works of
this art are the religious edifices erected in the twelfth and three
following centuries. These structures, uniting sublimity in general
composition with the beauties of variety and form, intricacy of parts,
skilful or at least fortunate effects of shadow and light, and in some
instances with extraordinary mechanical science, are naturally apt to lead
those antiquaries who are most conversant with them into too partial
estimates of the times wherein they were founded. They certainly are
accustomed to behold the fairest side of the picture. It was the favourite
and most honourable employment of ecclesiastical wealth, to erect, to
enlarge, to repair, to decorate cathedral and conventual churches. An
immense capital must have been expended upon these buildings in England
between the Conquest and the Reformation. And it is pleasing to observe
how the seeds of genius, hidden as it were under the frost of that dreary
winter, began to bud in the first sunshine of encouragement. In the
darkest period of the middle ages, especially after the Scandinavian
incursions into France and England, ecclesiastical architecture, though
always far more advanced than any other art, bespoke the rudeness and
poverty of the times. It began towards the latter part of the eleventh
century, when tranquillity, at least as to former enemies, was restored,
and some degree of learning reappeared, to assume a more noble appearance.
The Anglo-Norman cathedrals were perhaps as much distinguished above other
works of man in their own age, as the more splendid edifices of a later
period. The science manifested in them is not, however, very great; and
their style, though by no means destitute of lesser beauties, is upon the
whole an awkward imitation of Roman architecture, or perhaps more
immediately of the Saracenic buildings in Spain and those of the lower
Greek empire.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
But about the middle of the twelfth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> century, this
manner began to give place to what is improperly denominated the Gothic
architecture;<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
of which the pointed arch, formed by the segments of
two intersecting semicircles of equal radius and described about a common
diameter, has generally been deemed the essential characteristic. We are
not concerned at present to inquire whether this style originated in
France or Germany, Italy or England, since it was certainly almost
simultaneous in all these
countries;<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> nor from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> what source it was
derived&mdash;a question of no small difficulty. I would only venture to
remark, that whatever may be thought of the origin of the pointed arch,
for which there is more than one mode of accounting, we must perceive a
very oriental character in the vast profusion of ornament, especially on
the exterior surface, which is as distinguishing a mark of Gothic
buildings as their arches, and contributes in an eminent degree both to
their beauties and to their defects. This indeed is rather applicable to
the later than the earlier stage of architecture, and rather to
continental than English churches. Amiens is in a far more florid style
than Salisbury, though a contemporary structure. The Gothic species of
architecture is thought by most to have reached its perfection, considered
as an object of taste, by the middle or perhaps the close of the
fourteenth century, or at least to have lost something of its excellence
by the corresponding part of the next age; an effect of its early and
rapid cultivation, since arts appear to have, like individuals, their
natural progress and decay. The mechanical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
execution, however, continued
to improve, and is so far beyond the apparent intellectual powers of those
times, that some have ascribed the principal ecclesiastical structures to
the fraternity of freemasons, depositaries of a concealed and traditionary
science. There is probably some ground for this opinion; and the earlier
archives of that mysterious association, if they existed, might illustrate
the progress of Gothic architecture, and perhaps reveal its origin. The
remarkable change into this new style, that was almost contemporaneous in
every part of Europe, cannot be explained by any local circumstances, or
the capricious taste of a single
nation.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Agriculture in some degree progressive.</div>

<p>It would be a pleasing task to trace with satisfactory exactness the slow,
and almost perhaps insensible progress of agriculture and internal
improvement during the latter period of the middle ages. But no diligence
could recover the unrecorded history of a single village; though
considerable attention has of late been paid to this interesting subject
by those antiquaries, who, though sometimes affecting to despise the
lights of modern philosophy, are unconsciously guided by their effulgence.
I have already adverted to the wretched condition of agriculture during
the prevalence of feudal tenures, as well as before their general
establishment.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Yet even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
in the least civilized ages, there were not
wanting partial encouragements to cultivation, and the ameliorating
principle of human industry struggled against destructive revolutions and
barbarous disorder. The devastation of war from the fifth to the eleventh
century rendered land the least costly of all gifts, though it must ever
be the most truly valuable and permanent. Many of the grants to
monasteries, which strike us as enormous, were of districts absolutely
wasted, which would probably have been reclaimed by no other means. We owe
the agricultural restoration of a great part of Europe to the monks. They
chose, for the sake of retirement, secluded regions which they cultivated
with the labour of their hands.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
Several charters are extant, granted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
convents, and sometimes to laymen, of lands which they had recovered
from a desert condition, after the ravages of the
Saracens.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> Some
districts were allotted to a body of Spanish colonists, who emigrated, in
the reign of Louis the Debonair, to live under a Christian
sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
Nor is this the only instance of agricultural colonies. Charlemagne
transplanted part of his conquered Saxons into Flanders, a country at that
time almost unpeopled; and at a much later period, there was a remarkable
reflux from the same country, or rather from Holland to the coasts of the
Baltic Sea. In the twelfth century, great numbers of Dutch colonists
settled along the whole line between the Ems and the Vistula. They
obtained grants of uncultivated land on condition of fixed rents, and were
governed by their own laws under magistrates of their own
election.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<p>There cannot be a more striking proof of the low condition of English
agriculture in the eleventh century, than is exhibited by Domesday Book.
Though almost all England had been partially cultivated, and we find
nearly the same manors, except in the north, which exist at present, yet
the value and extent of cultivated ground are inconceivably small. With
every allowance for the inaccuracies and partialities of those by whom that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
famous survey was completed,<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
we are lost in amazement at the
constant recurrence of two or three carucates in demesne, with other lands
occupied by ten or a dozen villeins, valued altogether at forty shillings,
as the return of a manor, which now would yield a competent income to a
gentleman. If Domesday Book can he considered as even approaching to
accuracy in respect of these estimates, agriculture must certainly have
made a very material progress in the four succeeding centuries. This
however is rendered probable by other documents. Ingulfus, abbot of
Croyland under the Conqueror, supplies an early and interesting evidence
of improvement.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Richard de Rules, lord of Deeping, he tells us, being
fond of agriculture, obtained permission from the abbey to inclose a large
portion of marsh for the purpose of separate pasture, excluding the
Welland by a strong dike, upon which he erected a town, and rendering
those stagnant fens a garden of
Eden.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
In imitation of this spirited cultivator, the inhabitants of Spalding and some neighbouring villages by
a common resolution divided their marshes amongst them; when some
converting them to tillage, some reserving them for meadow, others leaving
them in pasture, they found a rich soil for every purpose. The abbey of
Croyland and villages in that neighbourhood followed this
example.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
This early instance of parochial inclosure is not to be overlooked in the
history of social progress. By the statute of Merton, in the 20th of Henry
III., the lord is permitted to approve, that is, to inclose the waste
lands of his manor, provided he leave sufficient common of pasture for the
freeholders. Higden, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
writer who lived about the time of Richard II.,
says, in reference to the number of hydes and vills of England at the
Conquest, that by clearing of woods, and ploughing up wastes, there were
many more of each in his age than formerly.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
And it might be easily presumed, independently of proof, that woods were cleared, marshes
drained, and wastes brought into tillage, during the long period that the
house of Plantagenet sat on the throne. From manerial surveys indeed and
similar instruments, it appears that in some places there was nearly as
much ground cultivated in the reign of Edward III. as at the present day.
The condition of different counties however was very far from being alike,
and in general the northern and western parts of England were the most
backward.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<p>The culture of arable land was very imperfect. Fleta remarks, in the reign
of Edward I. or II., that unless an acre yielded more than six bushels of
corn, the farmer would be a loser, and the land yield no
rent.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> And
Sir John Cullum, from very minute accounts, has calculated that nine or
ten bushels were a full average crop on an acre of wheat. An amazing
excess of tillage accompanied, and partly, I suppose, produced this
imperfect cultivation. In Hawsted, for example, under Edward I., there
were thirteen or fourteen hundred acres of arable, and only forty-five of
meadow ground. A similar disproportion occurs almost invariably in every
account we possess.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
This seems inconsistent with the low price of
cattle. But we must recollect, that the common pasture, often the most
extensive part of a manor, is not included, at least by any specific
measurement, in these surveys. The rent of land differed of course
materially; sixpence an acre seems to have been about the average for
arable land in the thirteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
though meadow was at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> double
or treble that sum. But the landlords were naturally solicitous to augment
a revenue that became more and more inadequate to their luxuries. They
grew attentive to agricultural concerns, and perceived that a high rate of
produce, against which their less enlightened ancestors had been used to
clamour, would bring much more into their coffers than it took away. The
exportation of corn had been absolutely prohibited. But the statute of the
15th Henry VI. c. 2, reciting that "on this account, farmers and others
who use husbandry, cannot sell their corn but at a low price, to the great
damage of the realm," permits it to be sent any where but to the king's
enemies, so long as the quarter of wheat shall not exceed 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in
value, or that of barley 3<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The price of wool was fixed in the thirty-second year of the same reign at
a minimum, below which no person was suffered to buy it, though he might
give more;<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
a provision neither wise nor equitable, but obviously
suggested by the same motive. Whether the rents of land were augmented in
any degree through these measures, I have not perceived; their great rise
took place in the reign of Henry VIII., or rather
afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> The
usual price of land under Edward IV. seems to have been ten years'
purchase.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its condition in France and Italy.</div>

<p>It may easily be presumed that an English writer can furnish very little
information as to the state of agriculture in foreign countries. In such
works relating to France as have fallen within my reach, I have found
nothing satisfactory, and cannot pretend to determine, whether the natural
tendency of mankind to ameliorate their condition had a greater influence
in promoting agriculture, or the vices inherent in the actual order of
society, and those public misfortunes to which that kingdom was exposed,
in retarding it.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
The state of Italy was far different; the rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Lombard plains, still more fertilized by irrigation, became a garden, and
agriculture seems to have reached the excellence which it still retains.
The constant warfare indeed of neighbouring cities is not very favourable
to industry; and upon this account we might incline to place the greatest
territorial improvement of Lombardy at an era rather posterior to that of
her republican government; but from this it primarily sprung; and without
the subjugation of the feudal aristocracy, and that perpetual demand upon
the fertility of the earth which an increasing population of citizens
produced, the valley of the Po would not have yielded more to human labour
than it had done for several preceding

The very curious treatise of
Crescentius exhibits the full details of Italian husbandry about 1300, and
might afford an interesting comparison to those who are acquainted with
its present state. That state indeed in many parts of Italy displays no
symptoms of decline. But whatever mysterious influence of soil or climate
has scattered the seeds of death on the western regions of Tuscany, had
not manifested itself in the middle ages. Among uninhabitable plains, the
traveller is struck by the ruins of innumerable castles and villages,
monuments of a time when pestilence was either unfelt, or had at least not
forbad the residence of mankind. Volterra, whose deserted walls look down
upon that tainted solitude, was once a small but free republic; Siena,
round whom, though less depopulated, the malignant influence hovers, was
once almost the rival of Florence. So melancholy and apparently
irresistible a decline of culture and population through physical causes,
as seems to have gradually overspread that portion of Italy, has not
perhaps been experienced in any other part of Europe, unless we except
Iceland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gardening.</div>

<p>The Italians of the fourteenth century seem to have paid some attention to
an art, of which, both as related to cultivation and to architecture, our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
own forefathers were almost entirely ignorant. Crescentius dilates upon
horticulture, and gives a pretty long list of herbs both esculent and
medicinal.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
His notions about the ornamental department are rather
beyond what we should expect, and I do not know that his scheme of a
flower-garden could be much amended. His general arrangements, which are
minutely detailed with evident fondness for the subject, would of course
appear too formal at present; yet less so than those of subsequent times;
and though acquainted with what is called the topiary art, that of
training or cutting trees into regular figures, he does not seem to run
into its extravagance. Regular gardens, according to Paulmy, were not made
in France till the sixteenth or even seventeenth
century;<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
yet one is said to have existed at the Louvre, of much older
construction.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
England, I believe, had nothing of the ornamental kind, unless it were
some trees regularly disposed in the orchard of a monastery. Even the
common horticultural art for culinary purposes, though not entirely
neglected, since the produce of gardens is sometimes mentioned in ancient
deeds, had not been cultivated with much
attention.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
The esculent vegetables now most in use were introduced in the reign of Elizabeth, and
some sorts a great deal later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in value of money.</div>

<p>I should leave this slight survey of economical history still more
imperfect, were I to make no observation on the relative values of money.
Without something like precision in our notions upon this subject, every
statistical inquiry becomes a source of confusion and error. But
considerable difficulties attend the discussion. These arise principally
from two causes; the inaccuracy or partial representations of historical
writers, on whom we are accustomed too implicitly to rely, and the change
of manners, which renders a certain command over articles of purchase less
adequate to our wants than it was in former ages.</p>

<p>The first of these difficulties is capable of being removed by a
circumspect use of authorities. When this part of statistical history
began to excite attention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
which was hardly perhaps before the
publication of Bishop Fleetwood's Chronicon Preciosum, so few authentic
documents had been published with respect to prices, that inquirers were
glad to have recourse to historians, even when not contemporary, for such
facts as they had thought fit to record. But these historians were
sometimes too distant from the times concerning which they wrote, and too
careless in their general character, to merit much regard; and even when
contemporary, were often credulous, remote from the concerns of the world,
and, at the best, more apt to register some extraordinary phenomenon of
scarcity or cheapness, than the average rate of pecuniary dealings. The
one ought, in my opinion, to be absolutely rejected as testimonies, the
other to be sparingly and diffidently
admitted.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> For it is no longer
necessary to lean upon such uncertain witnesses. During the last century a
very laudable industry has been shown by antiquaries in the publication of
account-books belonging to private persons, registers of expenses in
convents, returns of markets, valuations of goods, tavern-bills, and in
short every document, however trifling in itself, by which this important
subject can be illustrated. A sufficient number of such authorities,
proving the ordinary tenor of prices rather than any remarkable deviations
from it, are the true basis of a table, by which all changes in the value
of money should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
be measured. I have little doubt but that such a table
might be constructed from the data we possess with tolerable exactness,
sufficient at least to supersede one often quoted by political economists,
but which appears to be founded upon very superficial and erroneous
inquiries.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<p>It is by no means required that I should here offer such a table of
values, which, as to every country except England, I have no means of
constructing, and which, even as to England, would be subject to many
difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
But a reader unaccustomed to these investigations ought
to have some assistance in comparing the prices of ancient times with
those of his own. I will therefore, without attempting to ascend very
high, for we have really no sufficient data as to the period immediately
subsequent to the Conquest, much less that which preceded, endeavour at a
sort of approximation for the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. In the
reigns of Henry III. and Edward I., previously to the first debasement of
the coin by the latter in 1301, the ordinary price of a quarter of wheat
appears to have been about four shillings, and that of barley and oats in
proportion. A sheep was rather sold high at a shilling, and an ox might be
reckoned at ten or twelve.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
The value of cattle is, of course,
dependent upon their breed and condition, and we have unluckily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
no early account of butcher's meat; but we can hardly take a less multiple than
about thirty for animal food and eighteen or twenty for corn, in order to
bring the prices of the thirteenth century to a level with those of the
present day.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Combining the two, and setting the comparative dearness
of cloth against the cheapness of fuel and many other articles, we may
perhaps consider any given sum under Henry III. and Edward I. as
equivalent in general command over commodities to about twenty-four or
twenty-five times their nominal value at present. Under Henry VI. the coin
had lost one-third of its weight in silver, which caused a proportional
increase of money prices;<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
but, so far as I can perceive, there had
been no diminution in the value of that metal. We have not much
information as to the fertility of the mines which supplied Europe during
the middle ages; but it is probable that the drain of silver towards the
East, joined to the ostentatious splendour of courts, might fully absorb
the usual produce. By the statute 15 H. VI., c. 2, the price up to which
wheat might be exported is fixed at 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, a point no doubt above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
average; and the private documents of that period, which are
sufficiently numerous, lead to a similar
result.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
Sixteen will be a proper multiple when we would bring the general value of money in this
reign to our present standard.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> [1816.]</p>

<p>But after ascertaining the proportional values of money at different
periods by a comparison of the prices in several of the chief articles of
expenditure, which is the only fair process, we shall sometimes be
surprised at incidental facts of this class which seem irreducible to any
rule. These difficulties arise not so much from the relative scarcity of
particular commodities, which it is for the most part easy to explain, as
from the change in manners and in the usual mode of living. We have
reached in this age so high a pitch of luxury that we can hardly believe
or comprehend the frugality of ancient times; and have in general formed
mistaken notions as to the habits of expenditure which then prevailed.
Accustomed to judge of feudal and chivalrous ages by works of fiction, or
by historians who embellished their writings with accounts of occasional
festivals and tournaments, and sometimes inattentive enough to transfer
the manners of the seventeenth to the fourteenth century, we are not at
all aware of the usual simplicity with which the gentry lived under Edward
I. or even Henry VI. They drank little wine; they had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> foreign
luxuries; they rarely or never kept male servants except for husbandry;
their horses, as we may guess by the price, were indifferent; they seldom
travelled beyond their county. And even their hospitality must have been
greatly limited, if the value of manors were really no greater than we
find it in many surveys. Twenty-four seems a sufficient multiple when we
would raise a sum mentioned by a writer under Edward I. to the same real
value expressed in our present money, but an income of 10<i>l.</i> or 20<i>l.</i>
was reckoned a competent estate for a gentleman; at least the lord of a
single manor would seldom have enjoyed more. A knight who possessed
150<i>l.</i> per annum passed for extremely
rich.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
Yet this was not equal in command over commodities to 4000<i>l.</i> at present. But this income was
comparatively free from taxation, and its expenditure lightened by the
services of his villeins. Such a person, however, must have been among the
most opulent of country gentlemen. Sir John Fortescue speaks of five
pounds a year as "a fair living for a yeoman," a class of whom he is not
at all inclined to diminish the
importance.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> So, when Sir William
Drury, one of the richest men in Suffolk, bequeaths in 1493 fifty marks to
each of his daughters, we must not imagine that this was of greater value
than four or five hundred pounds at this day, but remark the family pride
and want of ready money which induced country gentlemen to leave their
younger children in poverty.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Or, if we read that the expense of a
scholar at the university in 1514 was but five pounds annually, we should
err in supposing that he had the liberal accommodation which the present
age deems indispensable, but consider how much could be afforded for about
sixty pounds, which will be not far from the proportion. And what would a
modern lawyer say to the following entry in the churchwarden's accounts of
St. Margaret, Westminster, for 1476: "Also paid to Roger Fylpott, learned
in the law, for his counsel giving, 3<i>s.</i> 8<i>d., with four-pence for his
dinner</i>"?<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> Though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
fifteen times the fee might not seem altogether
inadequate at present, five shillings would hardly furnish the table of a
barrister, even if the fastidiousness of our manners would admit of his
accepting such a dole. But this fastidiousness, which considers certain
kinds of remuneration degrading to a man of liberal condition, did not
prevail in those simple ages. It would seem rather strange that a young
lady should learn needlework and good breeding in a family of superior
rank, paying for her board; yet such was the laudable custom of the
fifteenth and even sixteenth centuries, as we perceive by the Paston
Letters, and even later authorities.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Labourers better paid than at present.</div>

<p>There is one very unpleasing remark which every one who attends to the
subject of prices will be induced to make, that the labouring classes,
especially those engaged in agriculture, were better provided with the
means of subsistence in the reign of Edward III. or of Henry VI. than they
are at present. In the fourteenth century Sir John Cullum observes a
harvest man had fourpence a day, which enabled him in a week to buy a comb
of wheat; but to buy a comb of wheat a man must now (1784) work ten or
twelve days.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
So, under Henry VI., if meat was at a farthing and a
half the pound, which I suppose was about the truth, a labourer earning
threepence a day, or eighteen pence in the week, could buy a bushel of
wheat at six shillings the quarter, and twenty-four pounds of meat for his
family. A labourer at present, earning twelve shillings a week, can only
buy half a bushel of wheat at eighty shillings the quarter, and twelve pounds of meat at
seven-pence.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> Several acts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span> parliament regulate
the wages that might be paid to labourers of different kinds. Thus the
statute of labourers in 1350 fixed the wages of reapers during harvest at
threepence a-day without diet, equal to five shillings at present; that of
23 H. VI., c. 12, in 1444, fixed the reapers' wages at five-pence and
those of common workmen in building at 3-1/2<i>d.</i>, equal to 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and
4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; that of 11 H. VII., c. 22, in 1496, leaves the wages of
labourers in harvest as before, but rather increases those of ordinary
workmen. The yearly wages of a chief hind or shepherd by the act of 1444
were 1<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i>, equivalent to about 20<i>l.</i>, those of a common servant in
husbandry 18<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, with meat and drink; they were somewhat augmented
by the statute of 1496.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
Yet, although these wages are regulated as a
maximum by acts of parliament, which may naturally be supposed to have had
a view rather towards diminishing than enhancing the current rate, I am
not fully convinced that they were not rather beyond it; private accounts
at least do not always correspond with these statutable
prices.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> And
it is necessary to remember that the uncertainty of employment, natural to
so imperfect a state of husbandry, must have diminished the labourers'
means of subsistence. Extreme dearth, not more owing to adverse seasons
than to improvident consumption,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
was frequently
endured.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> But after
every allowance of this kind I should find it difficult to resist the
conclusion that, however the labourer has derived benefit from the
cheapness of manufactured commodities and from many inventions of common
utility, he is much inferior in ability to support a family to his
ancestors three or four centuries ago. I know not why some have supposed
that meat was a luxury seldom obtained by the labourer. Doubtless he could
not have procured as much as he pleased. But, from the greater cheapness
of cattle, as compared with corn, it seems to follow that a more
considerable portion of his ordinary diet consisted of animal food than at
present. It was remarked by Sir John Fortescue that the English lived far
more upon animal diet than their rivals the French; and it was natural to
ascribe their superior strength and courage to this
cause.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> I should
feel much satisfaction in being convinced that no deterioration in the
state of the labouring classes has really taken place; yet it cannot, I
think, appear extraordinary to those who reflect, that the whole
population of England in the year 1377 did not much exceed 2,300,000
souls, about one-fifth of the results upon the last enumeration, an
increase with which that of the fruits of the earth cannot be supposed to
have kept an even pace.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvement in the moral character of Europe.</div>

<p>The second head to which I referred, the improvements of European society
in the latter period of the middle ages, comprehends several changes, not
always connected, with each other, which contributed to inspire a more
elevated tone of moral sentiment, or at least to restrain the commission
of crimes. But the general effect of these upon the human character is
neither so distinctly to be traced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
nor can it be arranged with so much
attention to chronology, as the progress of commercial wealth or of the
arts that depend upon it. We cannot from any past experience indulge the
pleasing vision of a constant and parallel relation between the moral and
intellectual energies, the virtues and the civilization of mankind. Nor is
any problem connected with philosophical history more difficult than to
compare the relative characters of different generations, especially if we
include a large geographical surface in our estimate. Refinement has its
evils as well as barbarism; the virtues that elevate a nation in one
century pass in the next to a different region; vice changes its form
without losing its essence; the marked features of individual character
stand out in relief from the surface of history, and mislead our judgment
as to the general course of manners; while political revolutions and a bad
constitution of government may always undermine or subvert the
improvements to which more favourable circumstances have contributed. In
comparing, therefore, the fifteenth with the twelfth century, no one would
deny the vast increase of navigation and manufactures, the superior
refinement of manners, the greater diffusion of literature. But should I
assert that man had raised himself in the latter period above the moral
degradation of a more barbarous age, I might be met by the question
whether history bears witness to any greater excesses of rapine and
inhumanity than in the wars of France and England under Charles VII., or
whether the rough patriotism and fervid passions of the Lombards in the
twelfth century were not better than the systematic treachery of their
servile descendants three hundred years afterwards. The proposition must
therefore be greatly limited; yet we can scarcely hesitate to admit, upon
a comprehensive view, that there were several changes during the last four
of the middle ages, which must naturally have tended to produce, and some
of which did unequivocally produce, a meliorating effect, within the
sphere of their operation, upon the moral character of society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elevation of the lower ranks.</div>

<p>The first and perhaps the most important of these, was the gradual
elevation of those whom unjust systems of polity had long depressed; of
the people itself, as opposed to the small number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span> of rich and noble, by
the abolition or desuetude of domestic and predial servitude, and by the
privileges extended to corporate towns. The condition of slavery is indeed
perfectly consistent with the observance of moral obligations; yet reason
and experience will justify the sentence of Homer, that he who loses his
liberty loses half his virtue. Those who have acquired, or may hope to
acquire, property of their own, are most likely to respect that of others;
those whom law protects as a parent are most willing to yield her a filial
obedience; those who have much to gain by the good-will of their fellow
citizens are most interested in the preservation of an honourable
character. I have been led, in different parts of the present work, to
consider these great revolutions in the order of society under other
relations than that of their moral efficacy; and it will therefore be
unnecessary to dwell upon them; especially as this efficacy is
indeterminate, though I think unquestionable, and rather to be inferred
from general reflections than capable of much illustration by specific
facts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Police.</div>

<p>We may reckon in the next place among the causes of moral improvement, a
more regular administration of justice according to fixed laws, and a more
effectual police. Whether the courts of judicature were guided by the
feudal customs or the Roman law, it was necessary for them to resolve
litigated questions with precision and uniformity. Hence a more distinct
theory of justice and good faith was gradually apprehended; and the moral
sentiments of mankind were corrected, as on such subjects they often
require to be, by clearer and better grounded inferences of reasoning.
Again, though it cannot be said that lawless rapine was perfectly
restrained even at the end of the fifteenth century, a sensible amendment
had been every where experienced. Private warfare, the licensed robbery of
feudal manners, had been subjected to so many mortifications by the kings
of France, and especially by St. Louis, that it can hardly be traced
beyond the fourteenth century. In Germany and Spain it lasted longer; but
the various associations for maintaining tranquillity in the former
country had considerably diminished its violence before the great national
measure of public peace adopted under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Maximilian.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> Acts of outrage
committed by powerful men became less frequent as the executive government
acquired more strength to chastise them. We read that St. Louis, the best
of French kings, imposed a fine upon the lord of Vernon for permitting a
merchant to be robbed in his territory between sunrise and sunset. For by
the customary law, though in general ill observed, the lord was bound to
keep the roads free from depredators in the day-time, in consideration of
the toll he received from passengers.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
The same prince was with
difficulty prevented from passing a capital sentence on Enguerrand de
Coucy, a baron of France, for a
murder.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
Charles the Fair actually put to death a nobleman of Languedoc for a series of robberies,
notwithstanding the intercession of the provincial
nobility.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> The
towns established a police of their own for internal security, and
rendered themselves formidable to neighbouring plunderers. Finally, though
not before the reign of Louis XI., an armed force was established for the
preservation of police.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
Various means were adopted in England to
prevent robberies, which indeed were not so frequently perpetrated as they
were on the continent, by men of high condition. None of these perhaps had
so much efficacy as the frequent sessions of judges under commissions of
gaol delivery. But the spirit of this country has never brooked that
coercive police which cannot exist without breaking in upon personal liberty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
by irksome regulations, and discretionary exercise of power; the
sure instrument of tyranny, which renders civil privileges at once
nugatory and insecure, and by which we should dearly purchase some real
benefits connected with its slavish discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious sects.</div>

<p>I have some difficulty in adverting to another source of moral improvement
during this period, the growth of religious opinions adverse to those of
the established church, both on account of its great obscurity, and
because many of these heresies were mixed up with an excessive fanaticism.
But they fixed themselves so deeply in the hearts of the inferior and more
numerous classes, they bore, generally speaking, so immediate a relation
to the state of manners, and they illustrate so much that more visible and
eminent revolution which ultimately rose out of them in the sixteenth
century, that I must reckon these among the most interesting phenomena in
the progress of European society.</p>

<p>Many ages elapsed, during which no remarkable instance occurs of a popular
deviation from the prescribed line of belief; and pious Catholics console
themselves by reflecting that their forefathers, in those times of
ignorance, slept at least the sleep of orthodoxy, and that their darkness
was interrupted by no false lights of human
reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
But from the twelfth century this can no longer be their boast. An inundation of heresy
broke in that age upon the church, which no persecution was able
thoroughly to repress, till it finally overspread half the surface of
Europe. Of this religious innovation we must seek the commencement in a
different part of the globe. The Manicheans afford an eminent example of
that durable attachment to a traditional creed, which so many ancient
sects, especially in the East, have cherished through the vicissitudes of
ages, in spite of persecution and contempt. Their plausible and widely
extended system had been in early times connected with the name of
Christianity, however incompatible with its doctrines and its history.
After a pretty long obscurity, the Manichean theory revived with some
modification in the western parts of Armenia, and was propagated in the
eighth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
ninth centuries by a sect denominated Paulicians. Their tenets
are not to be collected with absolute certainty from the mouths of their
adversaries, and no apology of their own survives. There seems however to
be sufficient evidence that the Paulicians, though professing to
acknowledge and even to study the apostolical writings, ascribed the
creation of the world to an evil deity, whom they supposed also to be the
author of the Jewish law, and consequently rejected all the Old Testament.
Believing, with the ancient Gnostics, that our Saviour was clothed on
earth with an impassive celestial body, they denied the reality of his
death and resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
These errors exposed them to a long and cruel
persecution, during which a colony of exiles was planted by one of the
Greek emperors in Bulgaria.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
From this settlement they silently
promulgated their Manichean creed over the western regions of Christendom.
A large part of the commerce of those countries with Constantinople was
carried on for several centuries by the channel of the Danube.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> This
opened an immediate intercourse with the Paulicians, who may be traced up
that river through Hungary and Bavaria, or sometimes taking the route of
Lombardy into Switzerland and
France.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
In the last country, and
especially in its southern and eastern provinces, they became conspicuous
under a variety of names; such as Catharists, Picards, Paterins, but above
all, Albigenses. It is beyond a doubt that many of these sectaries owed
their origin to the Paulicians; the appellation of Bulgarians was
distinctively bestowed upon them; and, according to some writers, they
acknowledged a primate or patriarch resident in that
country.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> The
tenets ascribed to them by all contemporary authorities coincide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span> so
remarkably with those held by the Paulicians, and in earlier times by the
Manicheans, that I do not see how we can reasonably deny what is confirmed
by separate and uncontradicted testimonies, and contains no intrinsic want
of probability.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[y]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Waldenses.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
But though, the derivation of these heretics called Albigenses from
Bulgaria is sufficiently proved, it is by no means to be concluded that
all who incurred the same imputation either derived their faith from the
same country, or had adopted the Manichean theory of the Paulicians. From
the very invectives of their enemies, and the acts of the Inquisition, it
is manifest that almost every shade of heterodoxy was found among these
dissidents, till it vanished in a simple protestation against the wealth
and tyranny of the clergy. Those who were absolutely free from any taint
of Manicheism are properly called Waldenses; a name perpetually confounded
in later times with that of Albigenses, but distinguishing a sect probably
of separate origin, and at least of different tenets. These, according to
the majority of writers, took their appellation from Peter Waldo, a
merchant of Lyons, the parent, about the year 1160, of a congregation of
seceders from the church, who spread very rapidly over France and
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
According to others, the original Waldenses were a race of uncorrupted
shepherds, who in the valleys of the Alps had shaken off, or perhaps never
learned, the system of superstition on which the Catholic church depended
for its ascendency. I am not certain whether their existence can be
distinctly traced beyond the preaching of Waldo, but it is well known that
the proper seat of the Waldenses or Vaudois has long continued to be in
certain valleys of Piedmont. These pious and innocent sectaries, of whom
the very monkish historians speak well, appear to have nearly resembled
the modern Moravians. They had ministers of their own appointment, and
denied the lawfulness of oaths and of capital punishment. In other
respects their opinions probably were not far removed from those usually
called Protestant. A simplicity of dress, and especially the use of wooden
sandals, was affected by this
people.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
I have already had occasion to relate the severe persecution which nearly
exterminated the Albigenses of Languedoc at the close of the twelfth
century, and involved the counts of Toulouse in their ruin. The
Catharists, a fraternity of the same Paulician origin, more dispersed than
the Albigenses, had previously sustained a similar trial. Their belief was
certainly a compound of strange errors with truth; but it was attended by
qualities of a far superior lustre to orthodoxy, by a sincerity, a piety,
and a self-devotion that almost purified the age in which they
lived.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
always important to perceive that these high moral excellences have
no necessary connexion with speculative truths; and upon this account I
have been more disposed to state explicitly the real Manicheism of the
Albigenses; especially as Protestant writers, considering all the enemies
of Rome as their friends, have been apt to place the opinions of these
sectaries in a very false light. In the course of time, undoubtedly, the
system of their Paulician teachers would have yielded, if the inquisitors
had admitted the experiment, to a more accurate study of the Scriptures,
and to the knowledge which they would have imbibed from the church itself.
And, in fact, we find that the peculiar tenets of Manicheism died away
after the middle of the thirteenth century, although a spirit of dissent
from the established creed broke out in abundant instances during the two
subsequent ages.</p>

<p>We are in general deprived of explicit testimonies in tracing the
revolutions of popular opinion. Much must therefore be left to conjecture;
but I am inclined to attribute a very extensive effect to the preaching of
these heretics. They appear in various countries nearly during the same
period, in Spain, Lombardy, Germany, Flanders, and England, as well as
France. Thirty unhappy persons, convicted of denying the sacraments, are
said to have perished at Oxford by cold and famine in the reign of Henry
II. In every country the new sects appear to have spread chiefly among the
lower people, which, while it accounts for the imperfect notice of
historians, indicates a more substantial influence upon the moral
condition of society than the conversion of a few nobles or
ecclesiastics.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
But even where men did not absolutely enlist under the banners of any new
sect, they were stimulated by the temper of their age to a more zealous
and independent discussion of their religious system. A curious
illustration of this is furnished by one of the letters of Innocent III.
He had been informed by the bishop of Metz, as he states to the clergy of
the diocese, that no small multitude of laymen and women, having procured
a translation of the gospels, epistles of St. Paul, the psalter, Job, and
other books of Scripture, to be made for them into French, meet in secret
conventicles to hear them read, and preach to each other, avoiding the
company of those who do not join in their devotion, and having been
reprimanded for this by some of their parish priests, have withstood them,
alleging reasons from the Scriptures, why they should not be so forbidden.
Some of them too deride the ignorance of their ministers, and maintain
that their own books teach them more than they can learn from the pulpit,
and that they can express it better. Although the desire of reading the
Scriptures, Innocent proceeds, is rather praiseworthy than reprehensible,
yet they are to be blamed for frequenting secret assemblies, for usurping
the office of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
preaching, deriding their own ministers, and scorning the
company of such as do not concur in their novelties. He presses the bishop
and chapter to discover the author of this translation, which could not
have been made without a knowledge of letters, and what were his
intentions, and what degree of orthodoxy and respect for the Holy See
those who used it possessed. This letter of Innocent III., however,
considering the nature of the man, is sufficiently temperate and
conciliatory. It seems not to have answered its end; for in another letter
he complains that some members of this little association continued
refractory and refused to obey either the bishop or the
pope.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<p>In the eighth and ninth centuries, when the Vulgate had ceased to be
generally intelligible, there is no reason to suspect any intention in the
church to deprive the laity of the Scriptures. Translations were freely
made into the vernacular languages, and perhaps read in churches, although
the acts of saints were generally deemed more instructive. Louis the
Debonair is said to have caused a German version of the New Testament to
be made. Otfrid, in the same century, rendered the gospels, or rather
abridged them, into German verse. This work is still extant, and is in
several respects an object of
curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
In the eleventh or twelfth century we find translations of the Psalms, Job, Kings, and the Maccabees
into French.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
But after the diffusion of heretical opinions, or, what
was much the same thing, of free inquiry, it became expedient to secure
the orthodox faith from lawless interpretation. Accordingly, the council
of Toulouse in 1229 prohibited the laity from possessing the Scriptures;
and this precaution was frequently repeated upon subsequent
occasions.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
The ecclesiastical history of the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries
teems with new sectaries and schismatics, various in their aberrations of
opinion, but all concurring in detestation of the established
church.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
They endured severe persecutions with a sincerity and firmness which in
any cause ought to command respect. But in general we find an extravagant
fanaticism among them; and I do not know how to look for any amelioration
of society from the Franciscan seceders, who quibbled about the property
of things consumed by use, or from the mystical visionaries of different
appellations, whose moral practice was sometimes more than equivocal.
Those who feel any curiosity about such subjects, which are by no means
unimportant, as they illustrate the history of the human mind, will find
them treated very fully by Mosheim. But the original sources of
information are not always accessible in this country, and the research
would perhaps be more fatiguing than profitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lollards of England.</div>

<p>I shall, for an opposite reason, pass lightly over the great revolution in
religious opinion wrought in England by Wicliffe, which will generally be
familiar to the reader from our common historians. Nor am I concerned to
treat of theological inquiries, or to write a history of the church.
Considered in its effects upon manners, the sole point which these pages
have in view, the preaching of this new sect certainly produced an
extensive reformation. But their virtues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
were by no means free from some
unsocial qualities, in which, as well as in their superior attributes, the
Lollards bear a very close resemblance to the Puritans of Elizabeth's
reign; a moroseness that proscribed all cheerful amusements, an
uncharitable malignity that made no distinction in condemning the
established clergy, and a narrow prejudice that applied the rules of the
Jewish law to modern institutions.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
Some of their principles were far
more dangerous to the good order of society, and cannot justly be ascribed
to the Puritans, though they grew afterwards out of the same soil. Such
was the notion, which is imputed also to the Albigenses, that civil
magistrates lose their right to govern by committing sin, or, as it was
quaintly expressed in the seventeenth century, that dominion is founded in
grace. These extravagances, however, do not belong to the learned and
politic Wicliffe, however they might be adopted by some of his
enthusiastic disciples.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Fostered by the general ill-will towards the
church, his principles made vast progress in England, and, unlike those of
earlier sectaries, were embraced by men of rank and civil influence.
Notwithstanding the check they sustained by the sanguinary law of Henry
IV., it is highly probable that multitudes secretly cherished them down to
the era of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hussites of Bohemia.</div>

<p>From England the spirit of religious innovation was propagated into
Bohemia; for though John Huss was very far from embracing all the
doctrinal system of Wicliffe, it is manifest that his zeal had been
quickened by the writings of that
reformer.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[m]</a> Inferior to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Englishman in ability, but exciting greater attention by his constancy and
sufferings, as well as by the memorable war which his ashes kindled, the
Bohemian martyr was even more eminently the precursor of the Reformation.
But still regarding these dissensions merely in a temporal light, I cannot
assign any beneficial effect to the schism of the Hussites, at least in
its immediate results, and in the country where it appeared. Though some
degree of sympathy with their cause is inspired by resentment at the ill
faith of their adversaries, and by the associations of civil and religious
liberty, we cannot estimate the Taborites and other sectaries of that
description but as ferocious and desperate
fanatics.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> Perhaps beyond
the confines of Bohemia more substantial good may have been produced by
the influence of its reformation, and a better tone of morals inspired
into Germany. But I must again repeat that upon this obscure and ambiguous
subject I assert nothing definitely, and little with confidence. The
tendencies of religious dissent in the four ages before the Reformation
appear to have generally conduced towards the moral improvement of
mankind; and facts of this nature occupy a far greater space in a
philosophical view of society during that period, than we might at first
imagine; but every one who is disposed to prosecute this inquiry will
assign their character according to the result of his own investigations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Institution of chivalry.</div>

<p>But the best school of moral discipline which the middle ages afforded was
the institution of chivalry. There is something perhaps to allow for the
partiality of modern writers upon this interesting subject; yet our most
sceptical criticism must assign a decisive influence to this great source
of human improvement. The more deeply it is considered, the more we shall
become sensible of its importance.</p>

<p>There are, if I may so say, three powerful spirits which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> have from time
to time moved over the face of the waters, and given a predominant impulse
to the moral sentiments and energies of mankind. These are the spirits of
liberty, of religion, and of honour. It was the principal business of
chivalry to animate and cherish the last of these three. And whatever high
magnanimous energy the love of liberty or religious zeal has ever imparted
was equalled by the exquisite sense of honour which this institution
preserved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its origin.</div>

<p>It appears probable that the custom of receiving arms at the age of
manhood with some solemnity was of immemorial antiquity among the nations
that overthrew the Roman empire. For it is mentioned by Tacitus to have
prevailed among their German ancestors; and his expressions might have
been used with no great variation to describe the actual ceremonies of
knighthood.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
There was even in that remote age a sort of public trial
as to the fitness of the candidate, which, though perhaps confined to his
bodily strength and activity, might be the germ of that refined
investigation which was thought necessary in the perfect stage of
chivalry. Proofs, though rare and incidental, might be adduced to show
that in the time of Charlemagne, and even earlier, the sons of monarchs at
least did not assume manly arms without a regular investiture. And in the
eleventh century it is evident that this was a general
practice.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[p]</a></p>

<p>This ceremony, however, would perhaps of itself have done little towards
forming that intrinsic principle which characterized the genuine chivalry.
But in the reign of Charlemagne we find a military distinction that
appears, in fact as well as in name, to have given birth to that
institution. Certain feudal tenants, and I suppose also alodial
proprietors, were bound to serve on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
horseback, equipped with the coat of
mail. These were called Caballarii, from which the word chevaliers is an
obvious corruption.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
But he who fought on horseback, and had been
invested with peculiar arms in a solemn manner, wanted nothing more to
render him a knight. Chivalry therefore may, in a general sense, be
referred to the age of Charlemagne. We may, however, go further, and
observe that these distinctive advantages above ordinary combatants were
probably the sources of that remarkable valour and that keen thirst for
glory, which became the essential attributes of a knightly character. For
confidence in our skill and strength is the usual foundation of courage;
it is by feeling ourselves able to surmount common dangers, that we become
adventurous enough to encounter those of a more extraordinary nature, and
to which more glory is attached. The reputation of superior personal
prowess, so difficult to be attained in the course of modern warfare, and
so liable to erroneous representations, was always within the reach of the
stoutest knight, and was founded on claims which could be measured with
much accuracy. Such is the subordination and mutual dependence in a modern
army, that every man must be content to divide his glory with his
comrades, his general, or his soldiers. But the soul of chivalry was
individual honour, coveted in so entire and absolute a perfection that it
must not be shared with an army or a nation. Most of the virtues it
inspired were what we may call independent, as opposed to those which are
founded upon social relations. The knights-errant of romance perform their
best exploits from the love of renown, or from a sort of abstract sense of
justice, rather than from any solicitude to promote the happiness of
mankind. If these springs of action are less generally beneficial, they
are, however, more connected with elevation of character than the
systematical prudence of men accustomed to social life. This solitary and
independent spirit of chivalry, dwelling, as it were, upon a rock, and
disdaining injustice or falsehood from a consciousness of internal
dignity, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
any calculation of their consequences, is not unlike
what we sometimes read of Arabian chiefs or the North American
Indians.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
These nations, so widely remote from each other, seem to
partake of that moral energy, which, among European nations far remote
from both of them, was excited by the spirit of chivalry. But the most
beautiful picture that was ever portrayed of this character is the
Achilles of Homer, the representative of chivalry in its most general
form, with all its sincerity and unyielding rectitude, all its courtesies
and munificence. Calmly indifferent to the cause in which he is engaged,
and contemplating with a serious and unshaken look the premature death
that awaits him, his heart only beats for glory and friendship. To this
sublime character, bating that imaginary completion by which the creations
of the poet, like those of the sculptor, transcend all single works of
nature, there were probably many parallels in the ages of chivalry;
especially before a set education and the refinements of society had
altered a little the natural unadulterated warrior of a ruder period. One
illustrious example from this earlier age is the Cid Ruy Diaz, whose
history has fortunately been preserved much at length in several
chronicles of ancient date and in one valuable poem; and though I will not
say that the Spanish hero is altogether a counterpart of Achilles in
gracefulness and urbanity, yet was he inferior to none that ever lived in
frankness, honour, and
magnanimity.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[s]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its connexion with feudal service.</div>

<div class="sidenote">This connexion broken.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
In the first state of chivalry, it was closely connected with the military
service of fiefs. The Caballarii in the Capitularies, the Milites of the
eleventh and twelfth centuries, were landholders who followed their lord
or sovereign into the field. A certain value of land was termed in England
a knight's fee, or in Normandy feudum loric√¶, fief de haubert, from the
coat of mail which it entitled and required the tenant to wear; a military
tenure was said to be by service in chivalry. To serve as knights, mounted
and equipped, was the common duty of vassals; it implied no personal
merit, it gave of itself a claim to no civil privileges. But this
knight-service founded upon a feudal obligation is to be carefully
distinguished from that superior chivalry, in which all was independent
and voluntary. The latter, in fact, could hardly flourish in its full
perfection till the military service of feudal tenure began to decline;
namely, in the thirteenth century. The origin of this personal chivalry I
should incline to refer to the ancient usage of voluntary commendation,
which I have mentioned in a former chapter. Men commended themselves, that
is, did homage and professed attachment to a prince or lord; generally
indeed for protection or the hope of reward, but sometimes probably for
the sake of distinguishing themselves in his quarrels. When they received
pay, which must have been the usual case, they were literally his
soldiers, or stipendiary troops. Those who could afford to exert their
valour without recompense were like the knights of whom we read in
romance, who served a foreign master through love, or thirst of glory, or
gratitude. The extreme poverty of the lower nobility, arising from the
subdivision of fiefs, and the politic generosity of rich lords, made this
connexion as strong as that of territorial dependence. A younger brother,
leaving the paternal estate, in which he took a slender share, might look to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
wealth and dignity in the service of a powerful count. Knighthood,
which he could not claim as his legal right, became the object of his
chief ambition. It raised him in the scale of society, equalling him in
dress, in arms, and in title, to the rich landholders. As it was due to
his merit, it did much more than equal him to those who had no pretensions
but from wealth; and the territorial knights became by degrees ashamed of
assuming the title till they could challenge it by real desert.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the crusades on chivalry.</div>

<p>This class of noble and gallant cavaliers serving commonly for pay, but on
the most honourable footing, became far more numerous through the
crusades; a great epoch in the history of European society. In these wars,
as all feudal service was out of the question, it was necessary for the
richer barons to take into their pay as many knights as they could afford
to maintain; speculating, so far as such motives operated, on an influence
with the leaders of the expedition, and on a share of plunder,
proportioned to the number of their followers. During the period of the
crusades, we find the institution of chivalry acquire its full vigour as
an order of personal nobility; and its original connexion with feudal
tenure, if not altogether effaced, became in a great measure forgotten in
the splendour and dignity of the new form which it wore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chivalry connected with religion.</div>

<p>The crusaders, however, changed in more than one respect the character of
chivalry. Before that epoch it appears to have had no particular reference
to religion. Ingulfus indeed tells us that the Anglo-Saxons preceded the
ceremony of investiture by a confession of their sins, and other pious
rites, and they received the order at the hands of a priest, instead of a
knight. But this was derided by the Normans as effeminacy, and seems to
have proceeded from the extreme devotion of the English before the
Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
We can hardly perceive indeed why the assumption of arms to
be used in butchering mankind should be treated as a religious ceremony.
The clergy, to do them justice, constantly opposed the private wars in
which the courage of those ages wasted itself; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> all bloodshed was
subject in strictness to a canonical penance. But the purposes for which
men bore arms in a crusade so sanctified their use, that chivalry acquired
the character as much of a religious as a military institution. For many
centuries, the recovery of the Holy Land was constantly at the heart of a
brave and superstitious nobility; and every knight was supposed at his
creation to pledge himself, as occasion should arise, to that cause.
Meanwhile, the defence of God's law against infidels was his primary and
standing duty. A knight, whenever present at mass, held the point of his
sword before him while the gospel was read, to signify his readiness to
support it. Writers of the middle ages compare the knightly to the
priestly character in an elaborate parallel, and the investiture of the
one was supposed analogous to the ordination of the other. The ceremonies
upon this occasion were almost wholly religious. The candidate passed
nights in prayer among priests in a church; he received the sacraments; he
entered into a bath, and was clad with a white robe, in allusion to the
presumed purification of his life; his sword was solemnly blessed; every
thing, in short, was contrived to identify his new condition with the
defence of religion, or at least of the
church.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">And with gallantry.</div>

<p>To this strong tincture of religion which entered into the composition of
chivalry from the twelfth century, was added another ingredient equally
distinguishing. A great respect for the female sex had always been a
remarkable characteristic of the Northern nations. The German women were
high-spirited and virtuous; qualities which might be causes or
consequences of the veneration with which they were regarded. I am not
sure that we could trace very minutely the condition of women for the
period between the subversion of the Roman empire and the first crusade;
but apparently man did not grossly abuse his superiority; and in point of
civil rights, and even as to the inheritance of property, the two sexes
were placed perhaps as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
nearly on a level as the nature of such warlike
societies would admit. There seems, however, to have been more roughness
in the social intercourse between the sexes than we find in later periods.
The spirit of gallantry which became so animating a principle of chivalry,
must be ascribed to the progressive refinement of society during the
twelfth and two succeeding centuries. In a rude state of manners, as among
the lower people in all ages, woman has not full scope to display those
fascinating graces, by which nature has designed to counterbalance the
strength and energy of mankind. Even where those jealous customs that
degrade alike the two sexes have not prevailed, her lot is domestic
seclusion; nor is she fit to share in the boisterous pastimes of drunken
merriment to which the intercourse of an unpolished people is confined.
But as a taste for the more elegant enjoyments of wealth arises, a taste
which it is always her policy and her delight to nourish, she obtains an
ascendency at first in the lighter hour, and from thence in the serious
occupations of life. She chases, or brings into subjection, the god of
wine, a victory which might seem more ignoble were it less difficult, and
calls in the aid of divinities more propitious to her ambition. The love
of becoming ornament is not perhaps to be regarded in the light of vanity;
it is rather an instinct which woman has received from nature to give
effect to those charms that are her defence; and when commerce began to
minister more effectually to the wants of luxury, the rich furs of the
North, the gay silks of Asia, the wrought gold of domestic manufacture,
illumined the halls of chivalry, and cast, as if by the spell of
enchantment, that ineffable grace over beauty which the choice and
arrangement of dress is calculated to bestow. Courtesy had always been the
proper attribute of knighthood; protection of the weak its legitimate
duty; but these were heightened to a pitch of enthusiasm when woman became
their object. There was little jealousy shown in the treatment of that
sex, at least in France, the fountain of chivalry; they were present at
festivals, at tournaments, and sat promiscuously in the halls of their
castle. The romance of Perceforest (and romances have always been deemed
good witnesses as to manners) tells of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
feast where eight hundred
knights had each of them a lady eating off his
plate.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> For to eat off
the same plate was an usual mark of gallantry or friendship.</p>

<p>Next therefore, or even equal to devotion, stood gallantry among the
principles of knighthood. But all comparison between the two was saved by
blending them together. The love of God and the ladies was enjoined as a
single duty. He who was faithful and true to his mistress was held sure of
salvation in the theology of castles though not of
cloisters.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
Froissart announces that he had undertaken a collection of amorous poetry
with the help of God and of love; and Boccace returns thanks to each for
their assistance in the Decameron. The laws sometimes united in this
general homage to the fair. "We will," says James II. of Aragon, "that
every man, whether knight or no, who shall be in company with a lady, pass
safe and unmolested, unless he be guilty of
murder."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> Louis II., duke
of Bourbon, instituting the order of the Golden Shield, enjoins his
knights to honour above all the ladies, and not to permit any one to
slander them, "because from them after God comes all the honour that men
can acquire."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>The gallantry of those ages, which was very often adulterous, had
certainly no right to profane the name of religion; but its union with
valour was at least more natural, and became so intimate, that the same
word has served to express both qualities. In the French and English wars
especially, the knights of each country brought to that serious conflict
the spirit of romantic attachment which had been cherished in the hours of
peace. They fought at Poitiers or Verneuil as they had fought at
tournaments, bearing over their armour scarves and devices as the livery
of their mistresses, and asserting the paramount beauty of her they served
in vaunting challenges towards the enemy. Thus in the middle of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> keen
skirmish at Cherbourg, the squadrons remained motionless, while one knight
challenged to a single combat the most amorous of the adversaries. Such a
defiance was soon accepted, and the battle only recommenced when one of
the champions had lost his life for his
love.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
In the first campaign of Edward's war some young English knights wore a covering over one eye,
vowing, for the sake of their ladies, never to see with both till they
should have signalized their prowess in the
field.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> These
extravagances of chivalry are so common that they form part of its general
character, and prove how far a course of action which depends upon the
impulses of sentiment may come to deviate from common sense.</p>

<p>It cannot be presumed that this enthusiastic veneration, this devotedness
in life and death, were wasted upon ungrateful natures. The goddesses of
that idolatry knew too well the value of their worshippers. There has
seldom been such adamant about the female heart, as can resist the highest
renown for valour and courtesy, united with the steadiest fidelity. "He
loved," says Froissart of Eustace d'Auberthicourt, "and afterwards married
lady Isabel, daughter of the count of Juliers. This lady too loved lord
Eustace for the great exploits in arms which she heard told of him, and
she sent him horses and loving letters, which made the said lord Eustace
more bold than before, and he wrought such feats of chivalry, that all in
his company were gainers."<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
It were to be wished that the sympathy of
love and valour had always been as honourable. But the morals of chivalry,
we cannot deny, were not pure. In the amusing fictions which seem to have
been the only popular reading of the middle ages, there reigns a
licentious spirit, not of that slighter kind which is usual in such
compositions, but indicating a general dissoluteness in the intercourse of
the sexes. This has often been noticed of Boccaccio and the early Italian
novelists; but it equally characterized the tales and romances of France,
whether metrical or in prose, and all the poetry of the
Troubadours.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
The violation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
marriage vows passes in them for an incontestable
privilege of the brave and the fair; and an accomplished knight seems to
have enjoyed as undoubted prerogatives, by general consent of opinion, as
were claimed by the brilliant courtiers of Louis XV.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues deemed essential to chivalry.</div>

<p>But neither that emulous valour which chivalry excited, nor the religion
and gallantry which were its animating principles, alloyed as the latter
were by the corruption of those ages, could have rendered its institution
materially conducive to the moral improvement of society. There were,
however, excellences of a very high class which it equally encouraged. In
the books professedly written to lay down the duties of knighthood, they
appear to spread over the whole compass of human obligations. But these,
like other books of morality, strain their schemes of perfection far
beyond the actual practice of mankind. A juster estimate of chivalrous
manners is to be deduced from romances. Yet in these, as in all similar
fictions, there must be a few ideal touches beyond the simple truth of
character; and the picture can only be interesting when it ceases to
present images of mediocrity or striking imperfection. But they referred
their models of fictitious heroism to the existing standard of moral
approbation; a rule, which, if it generally falls short of what reason and
religion prescribe, is always beyond the average tenor of human conduct.
From these and from history itself we may infer the tendency of chivalry
to elevate and purify the moral feelings. Three virtues may particularly
be noticed as essential in the estimation of mankind to the character of a
knight; loyalty, courtesy, and munificence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loyalty.</div>

<p>The first of these in its original sense may be defined, fidelity to
engagements; whether actual promises, or such tacit obligations as bound a
vassal to his lord and a subject to his prince. It was applied also, and
in the utmost strictness, to the fidelity of a lover towards the lady he
served. Breach of faith, and especially of an express promise, was held a
disgrace that no valour could redeem. False, perjured, disloyal, recreant,
were the epithets which he must be compelled to endure who had swerved
from a plighted engagement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
even towards an enemy. This is one of the most
striking changes produced by chivalry. Treachery, the usual vice of savage
as well as corrupt nations, became infamous during the vigour of that
discipline. As personal rather than national feelings actuated its heroes,
they never felt that hatred, much less that fear of their enemies, which
blind men to the heinousness of ill faith. In the wars of Edward III.,
originating in no real animosity, the spirit of honourable as well as
courteous behaviour towards the foe seems to have arrived at its highest
point. Though avarice may have been the primary motive of ransoming
prisoners instead of putting them to death, their permission to return
home on the word of honour in order to procure the stipulated sum&mdash;an
indulgence never refused&mdash;could only be founded on experienced confidence
in the principles of chivalry.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Courtesy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Liberality.</div>

<p>A knight was unfit to remain a member of the order if he violated his
faith; he was ill acquainted with its duties if he proved wanting in
courtesy. This word expressed the most highly refined good breeding,
founded less upon a knowledge of ceremonious politeness, though this was
not to be omitted, than on the spontaneous modesty, self-denial, and
respect for others, which ought to spring from his heart. Besides the
grace which this beautiful virtue threw over the habits of social life, it
softened down the natural roughness of war, and gradually introduced that
indulgent treatment of prisoners which was almost unknown to antiquity.
Instances of this kind are continual in the later period of the middle
ages. An Italian writer blames the soldier who wounded Eccelin, the famous
tyrant of Padua, after he was taken. "He deserved," says he, "no praise,
but rather the greatest infamy for his baseness; since it is as vile an
act to wound a prisoner, whether noble or otherwise, as to strike a dead
body."<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
Considering the crimes of Eccelin, this sentiment is a
remarkable proof of generosity. The behaviour of Edward III. to Eustace de
Ribaumont, after the capture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
of Calais, and that, still more exquisitely
beautiful, of the Black Prince to his royal prisoner at Poitiers, are such
eminent instances of chivalrous virtue, that I omit to repeat them only
because they are so well known. Those great princes too might be imagined
to have soared far above the ordinary track of mankind. But in truth, the
knights who surrounded them and imitated their excellences, were only
inferior in opportunities of displaying the same virtue. After the battle
of Poitiers, "the English and Gascon knights," says Froissart, "having
entertained their prisoners, went home each of them with the knights or
squires he had taken, whom he then questioned upon their honour what
ransom they could pay without inconvenience, and easily gave them credit;
and it was common for men to say, that they would not straiten any knight
or squire so that he should not live well and keep up his
honour."<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
Liberality, indeed, and disdain of money, might be reckoned, as I have
said, among the essential virtues of chivalry. All the romances inculcate
the duty of scattering their wealth with profusion, especially towards
minstrels, pilgrims, and the poorer members of their own order. The last,
who were pretty numerous, had a constant right to succour from the
opulent; the castle of every lord, who respected the ties of knighthood,
was open with more than usual hospitality to the traveller whose armour
announced his dignity, though it might also conceal his
poverty.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Justice.</div>

<p>Valour, loyalty, courtesy, munificence, formed collectively the character
of an accomplished knight, so far as was displayed in the ordinary tenor
of his life, reflecting these virtues as an unsullied mirror. Yet
something more was required for the perfect idea of chivalry, and enjoined
by its principles; an active sense of justice, an ardent indignation
against wrong, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
determination of courage to its best end, the prevention
or redress of injury. It grew up as a salutary antidote in the midst of
poisons, while scarce any law but that of the strongest obtained regard,
and the rights of territorial property, which are only rights as they
conduce to general good, became the means of general oppression. The real
condition of society, it has sometimes been thought, might suggest stories
of knight-errantry, which were wrought up into the popular romances of the
middle ages. A baron, abusing the advantage of an inaccessible castle in
the fastnesses of the Black Forest or the Alps, to pillage the
neighbourhood and confine travellers in his dungeon, though neither a
giant nor a Saracen, was a monster not less formidable, and could perhaps
as little be destroyed without the aid of disinterested bravery.
Knight-errantry, indeed, as a profession, cannot rationally be conceived
to have had any existence beyond the precincts of romance. Yet there seems
no improbability in supposing that a knight, journeying through
uncivilized regions in his way to the Holy Land, or to the court of a
foreign sovereign, might find himself engaged in adventures not very
dissimilar to those which are the theme of romance. We cannot indeed
expect to find any historical evidence of such incidents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resemblance of chivalrous to eastern manners.</div>

<p>The characteristic virtues of chivalry bear so much resemblance to those
which eastern writers of the same period extol, that I am a little
disposed to suspect Europe of having derived some improvement from
imitation of Asia. Though the crusades began in abhorrence of infidels,
this sentiment wore off in some degree before their cessation; and the
regular intercourse of commerce, sometimes of alliance, between the
Christians of Palestine and the Saracens, must have removed part of the
prejudice, while experience of their enemy's courage and generosity in war
would with those gallant knights serve to lighten the remainder. The
romancers expatiate with pleasure on the merits of Saladin, who actually
received the honour of knighthood from Hugh of Tabaria, his prisoner. An
ancient poem, entitled the Order of Chivalry, is founded upon this story,
and contains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
a circumstantial account of the ceremonies, as well as
duties, which the institution
required.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
One or two other instances of
a similar kind bear witness to the veneration in which the name of knight
was held among the eastern nations. And certainly the Mohammedan
chieftains were for the most part abundantly qualified to fulfil the
duties of European chivalry. Their manners had been polished and
courteous, while the western kingdoms were comparatively barbarous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evils produced by the spirit of chivalry.</div>

<p>The principles of chivalry were not, I think, naturally productive of many
evils. For it is unjust to class those acts of oppression or disorder
among the abuses of knighthood, which were committed in spite of its
regulations, and were only prevented by them from becoming more extensive.
The licence of times so imperfectly civilized could not be expected to
yield to institutions, which, like those of religion, fell prodigiously
short in their practical result of the reformation which they were
designed to work. Man's guilt and frailty have never admitted more than a
partial corrective. But some bad consequences may be more fairly ascribed
to the very nature of chivalry. I have already mentioned the dissoluteness
which almost unavoidably resulted from the prevailing tone of gallantry.
And yet we sometimes find in the writings of those times a spirit of pure
but exaggerated sentiment; and the most fanciful refinements of passion
are mingled by the same poets with the coarsest immorality. An undue
thirst for military renown was another fault that chivalry must have
nourished; and the love of war, sufficiently pernicious in any shape, was
more founded, as I have observed, on personal feelings of honour, and less
on public spirit, than in the citizens of free states. A third reproach
may be made to the character of knighthood, that it widened the separation
between the different classes of society, and confirmed that
aristocratical spirit of high birth, by which the large mass of mankind
were kept in unjust degradation. Compare the generosity of Edward III.
towards Eustace de Ribaumont at the siege of Calais with the harshness of
his conduct towards the citizens. This may be illustrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span> by a story from
Joinville, who was himself imbued with the full spirit of chivalry, and
felt like the best and bravest of his age. He is speaking of Henry count
of Champagne, who acquired, says he, very deservedly, the surname of
Liberal, and adduces the following proof of it. A poor knight implored of
him on his knees one day as much money as would serve to marry his two
daughters. One Arthault de Nogent, a rich burgess, willing to rid the
count of this importunity, but rather awkward, we must own, in the turn of
his argument, said to the petitioner; My lord has already given away so
much that he has nothing left. Sir Villain, replied Henry, turning round
to him, you do not speak truth in saying that I have nothing left to give,
when I have got yourself. Here, Sir Knight, I give you this man and
warrant your possession of him. Then, says Joinville, the poor knight was
not at all confounded, but seized hold of the burgess fast by the collar,
and told him he should not go till he had ransomed himself. And in the end
he was forced to pay a ransom of five hundred pounds. The simple-minded
writer who brings this evidence of the count of Champagne's liberality is
not at all struck with the facility of a virtue that is exercised at the
cost of others.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Circumstances tending to promote it.</div>

<p>There is perhaps enough in the nature of this institution and its
congeniality to the habits of a warlike generation to account for the
respect in which it was held throughout Europe. But several collateral
circumstances served to invigorate its spirit. Besides the powerful
efficacy with which the poetry and romance of the middle ages stimulated
those susceptible minds which were alive to no other literature, we may
enumerate four distinct causes tending to the promotion of chivalry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Regular education for knighthood.</div>

<p>The first of these was the regular scheme of education, according to which
the sons of gentlemen from the age of seven years, were brought up in the
castles of superior lords, where they at once learned the whole discipline
of their future profession, and imbibed its emulous and enthusiastic
spirit. This was an inestimable advantage to the poorer nobility, who
could hardly otherwise have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
given their children the accomplishments of
their station. From seven to fourteen these boys were called pages or
varlets; at fourteen they bore the name of esquire. They were instructed
in the management of arms, in the art of horsemanship, in exercises of
strength and activity. They became accustomed to obedience and courteous
demeanour, serving their lord or lady in offices which had not yet become
derogatory to honourable birth, and striving to please visitors, and
especially ladies, at the ball or banquet. Thus placed in the centre of
all that could awaken their imaginations, the creed of chivalrous
gallantry, superstition, or honour must have made indelible impressions.
Panting for the glory which neither their strength nor the established
rules permitted them to anticipate, the young scions of chivalry attended
their masters to the tournament, and even to the battle, and riveted with
a sigh the armour they were forbidden to
wear.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Encouragement of princes. Tournaments.</div>

<p>It was the constant policy of sovereigns to encourage this institution,
which furnished them with faithful supports, and counteracted the
independent spirit of feudal tenure. Hence they displayed a lavish
magnificence in festivals and tournaments, which may be reckoned a second
means of keeping up the tone of chivalrous feeling. The kings of France
and England held solemn or plenary courts at the great festivals, or at
other times, where the name of knight was always a title to admittance;
and the masque of chivalry, if I may use the expression, was acted in
pageants and ceremonies fantastical enough in our apprehension, but well
calculated for those heated understandings. Here the peacock and the
pheasant, birds of high fame in romance, received the homage of all true
knights.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
The most singular festival of this kind was that celebrated
by Philip duke of Burgundy, in 1453. In the midst of the banquet a pageant
was introduced, representing the calamitous state of religion in
consequence of the recent capture of Constantinople. This was followed by
the appearance of a pheasant, which was laid before the duke, and to which
the knights present addressed their vows to undertake a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> crusade, in the
following very characteristic preamble: I swear before God my Creator in
the first place, and the glorious Virgin his mother, and next before the
ladies and the pheasant.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
Tournaments were a still more powerful
incentive to emulation. These may be considered to have arisen about the
middle of the eleventh century; for though every martial people have found
diversion in representing the image of war, yet the name of tournaments,
and the laws that regulated them, cannot be traced any
higher.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[q]</a> Every
scenic performance of modern times must be tame in comparison of these
animating combats. At a tournament, the space enclosed within the lists
was surrounded by sovereign princes and their noblest barons, by knights
of established renown, and all that rank and beauty had most distinguished
among the fair. Covered with steel, and known only by their emblazoned
shield or by the favours of their mistresses, a still prouder bearing, the
combatants rushed forward to a strife without enmity, but not without
danger. Though their weapons were pointless, and sometimes only of wood,
though they were bound by the laws of tournaments to strike only upon the
strong armour of the trunk, or, as it was called, between the four limbs,
those impetuous conflicts often terminated in wounds and death. The church
uttered her excommunications in vain against so wanton an exposure to
peril; but it was more easy for her to excite than to restrain that
martial enthusiasm. Victory in a tournament was little less glorious, and
perhaps at the moment more exquisitely felt, than in the field; since no
battle could assemble such witnesses of valour. "Honour to the sons of the
brave," resounded amidst the din of martial music from the lips of the
minstrels, as the conqueror advanced to receive the prize from his queen
or his mistress; while the surrounding multitude acknowledged in his
prowess of that day an augury of triumphs that might in more serious
contests be blended with those of his
country.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Privileges of knighthood.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
Both honorary and substantial privileges belonged to the condition of
knighthood, and had of course a material tendency to preserve its credit.
A knight was distinguished abroad by his crested helmet, his weighty
armour, whether of mail or plate, bearing his heraldic coat, by his gilded
spurs, his horse barded with iron, or clothed in housing of gold; at home,
by richer silks and more costly furs than were permitted to squires, and
by the appropriated colour of scarlet. He was addressed by titles of more
respect.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Many civil offices, by rule or usage, were confined to his
order. But perhaps its chief privilege was to form one distinct class of
nobility extending itself throughout great part of Europe, and almost
independent, as to its rights and dignities, of any particular sovereign.
Whoever had been legitimately dubbed a knight in one country became, as it
were, a citizen of universal chivalry, and might assume most of its
privileges in any other. Nor did he require the act of a sovereign to be
thus distinguished. It was a fundamental principle that any knight might
confer the order; responsible only in his own reputation if he used
lightly so high a prerogative. But as all the distinctions of rank might
have been confounded, if this right had been without limit, it was an
equally fundamental rule, that it could only be exercised in favour of
gentlemen.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
The privileges annexed to chivalry were of peculiar advantage to the
vavassors, or inferior gentry, as they tended to counterbalance the
influence which territorial wealth threw into the scale of their feudal
suzerains. Knighthood brought these two classes nearly to a level; and it
is owing perhaps in no small degree to this institution that the lower
nobility saved themselves, notwithstanding their poverty, from being
confounded with the common people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Connexion of chivalry with military service.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Knights-bannerets and bachelors.</div>

<p>Lastly, the customs of chivalry were maintained by their connexion with
military service. After armies, which we may call comparatively regular,
had superseded in a great degree the feudal militia, princes were anxious
to bid high for the service of knights, the best-equipped and bravest
warriors of the time, on whose prowess the fate of battles was for a long
period justly supposed to depend. War brought into relief the generous
virtues of chivalry, and gave lustre to its distinctive privileges. The
rank was sought with enthusiastic emulation through heroic achievements,
to which, rather than to mere wealth and station, it was considered to
belong. In the wars of France and England, by far the most splendid period
of this institution, a promotion of knights followed every success,
besides the innumerable cases where the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
honour rewarded individual
bravery.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
It may here be mentioned that an honorary distinction was
made between knights-bannerets and
bachelors.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
The former were the
richest and best accompanied. No man could properly be a banneret unless
he possessed a certain estate, and could bring a certain number of lances
into the field.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
His distinguishing mark was the square banner,
carried by a squire at the point of his lance; while the knight-bachelor
had only the coronet or pointed pendant. When a banneret was created, the
general cut off this pendant to render the banner
square.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[z]</a> But this
distinction, however it elevated the banneret, gave him no claim to
military command, except over his own dependents or men at arms. Chandos
was still a knight-bachelor when he led part of the prince of Wales's army
into Spain. He first raised his banner at the battle of Navarette; and the
narration that Froissart gives of the ceremony will illustrate the manners
of chivalry and the character of that admirable hero, the conqueror of Du
Guesclin and pride of English chivalry, whose fame with posterity has been
a little overshadowed by his master's
laurels.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
What seems more extraordinary is, that mere squires had frequently the command over
knights. Proofs of this are almost continual in Froissart. But the vast
estimation in which men held the dignity of knighthood led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> them sometimes
to defer it for great part of their lives, in hope of signalizing their
investiture by some eminent exploit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline of chivalry.</div>

<p>These appear to have been the chief means of nourishing the principles of
chivalry among the nobility of Europe. But notwithstanding all
encouragement, it underwent the usual destiny of human institutions. St.
Palaye, to whom we are indebted for so vivid a picture of ancient manners,
ascribes the decline of chivalry in France to the profusion with which the
order was lavished under Charles VI., to the establishment of the
companies of ordonnance by Charles VII., and to the extension of knightly
honours to lawyers, and other men of civil occupation, by Francis
I.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
But the real principle of decay was something different from these three
subordinate circumstances, unless so far as it may bear some relation to
the second. It was the invention of gunpowder that eventually overthrew
chivalry. From the time when the use of fire-arms became tolerably perfect
the weapons of former warfare lost their efficacy, and physical force was
reduced to a very subordinate place in the accomplishments of a soldier.
The advantages of a disciplined infantry became more sensible; and the
lancers, who continued till almost the end of the sixteenth century to
charge in a long line, felt the punishment of their presumption and
indiscipline. Even in the wars of Edward III., the disadvantageous tactics
of chivalry must have been perceptible; but the military art had not been
sufficiently studied to overcome the prejudices of men eager for
individual distinction. Tournaments became less frequent; and, after the
fatal accident of Henry II., were entirely discontinued in France.
Notwithstanding the convulsions of the religious wars, the sixteenth
century was more tranquil than any that had preceded; and thus a large
part of the nobility passed their lives in pacific habits, and if they
assumed the honours of chivalry, forgot their natural connexion with
military prowess. This is far more applicable to England, where, except
from the reign of Edward III. to that of Henry VI., chivalry, as a
military institution, seems not to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
found a very congenial
soil.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
To these circumstances, immediately affecting the military condition of
nations, we must add the progress of reason and literature, which made
ignorance discreditable even in a soldier, and exposed the follies of
romance to a ridicule which they were very ill calculated to endure.</p>

<p>The spirit of chivalry left behind it a more valuable successor. The
character of knight gradually subsided in that of gentleman; and the one
distinguishes European society in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
as much as the other did in the preceding ages. A jealous sense of honour,
less romantic, but equally elevated, a ceremonious gallantry and
politeness, a strictness in devotional observances, a high pride of birth
and feeling of independence upon any sovereign for the dignity it gave, a
sympathy for martial honour, though more subdued by civil habits, are the
lineaments which prove an indisputable descent. The cavaliers of Charles
I. were genuine successors of Edward's knights; and the resemblance is
much more striking, if we ascend to the civil wars of the League. Time has
effaced much also of this gentlemanly, as it did before of the chivalrous
character. From the latter part of the seventeenth century its vigour and
purity have undergone a tacit decay, and yielded, perhaps in every
country, to increasing commercial wealth, more diffused instruction, the
spirit of general liberty in some, and of servile obsequiousness in
others, the modes of life in great cities, and the levelling customs of
social intercourse.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Literature.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
It is now time to pass to a very different subject. The third head under
which I classed the improvements of society during the four last centuries
of the middle ages was that of literature. But I must apprise the reader
not to expect any general view of literary history, even in the most
abbreviated manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Such an epitome would not only be necessarily
superficial, but foreign in many of its details to the purposes of this
chapter, which, attempting to develop the circumstances that gave a new
complexion to society, considers literature only so far as it exercised a
general and powerful influence. The private researches, therefore, of a
single scholar, unproductive of any material effect in his generation,
ought not to arrest us, nor indeed would a series of biographical notices,
into which literary history is apt to fall, be very instructive to a
philosophical inquirer. But I have still a more decisive reason against
taking a large range of literary history into the compass of this work,
founded on the many contributions which have been made within the last
forty years in that department, some of them even since the commencement
of my own labour.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
These have diffused so general an acquaintance with
the literature of the middle ages, that I must, in treating the subject,
either compile secondary information from well-known books, or enter upon
a vast field of reading, with little hope of improving upon what has been
already said, or even acquiring credit for original research. I shall,
therefore, confine myself to four points: the study of civil law; the
institution of universities; the application of modern languages to
literature, and especially to poetry; and the revival of ancient learning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil law.</div>

<p>The Roman law had been nominally preserved ever since the destruction of
the empire; and a great portion of the inhabitants of France and Spain, as
well as Italy, were governed by its provisions. But this was a mere
compilation from the Theodosian code; which itself contained only the more
recent laws promulgated after the establishment of Christianity, with some
fragments from earlier collections. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span> made by order of Alaric king
of the Visigoths about the year 500, and it is frequently confounded, with
the Theodosian code by writers of the dark
ages.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> The code of
Justinian, reduced into system after the separation of the two former
countries from the Greek empire, never obtained any authority in them; nor
was it received in the part of Italy subject to the Lombards. But that
this body of laws was absolutely unknown in the West during any period
seems to have been too hastily supposed. Some of the more eminent
ecclesiastics, as Hincmar and Ivon of Chartres, occasionally refer to it,
and bear witness to the regard which the Roman church had uniformly paid
to its decisions.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>The revival of the study of jurisprudence, as derived from the laws of
Justinian, has generally been ascribed to the discovery made of a copy of
the Pandects at Amalfi, in 1135, when that city was taken by the Pisans.
This fact, though not improbable, seems not to rest upon sufficient
evidence.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
But its truth is the less material, as it appears to be
unequivocally proved that the study of Justinian's system had recommenced
before that era. Early in the twelfth century a professor named
Irnerius<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
opened a school of civil law at Bologna, where he commented,
if not on the Pandects, yet on the other books, the Institutes and Code,
which were sufficient to teach the principles and inspire the love of that
comprehensive jurisprudence. The study of law, having thus revived, made a
surprising progress; within fifty years Lombardy was full of lawyers, on
whom Frederic Barbarossa and Alexander III., so hostile in every other
respect, conspired to shower honours and privileges. The schools of
Bologna were pre-eminent throughout this century for legal learning. There
seem also to have been seminaries at Modena and Mantua; nor was any
considerable city without distinguished civilians. In the next age they
became still more numerous, and their professors more conspicuous, and
universities arose at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
Naples, Padua, and other places, where the Roman
law was the object of peculiar
regard.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<p>There is apparently great justice in the opinion of Tiraboschi, that by
acquiring internal freedom and the right of determining controversies by
magistrates of their own election, the Italian cities were led to require
a more extensive and accurate code of written laws than they had hitherto
possessed. These municipal judges were chosen from among the citizens, and
the succession to offices was usually so rapid, that almost every freeman
might expect in his turn to partake in the public government, and
consequently in the administration of justice. The latter had always
indeed been exercised in the sight of the people by the count and his
assessors under the Lombard and Carlovingian sovereigns; but the laws were
rude, the proceedings tumultuary, and the decisions perverted by violence.
The spirit of liberty begot a stronger sense of right; and right, it was
soon perceived, could only be secured by a common standard. Magistrates
holding temporary offices, and little elevated in those simple times above
the citizens among whom they were to return, could only satisfy the
suitors, and those who surrounded their tribunal, by proving the
conformity of their sentences to acknowledged authorities. And the
practice of alleging reasons in giving judgment would of itself introduce
some uniformity of decision and some adherence to great rules of justice
in the most arbitrary tribunals; while, on the other hand, those of a free
country lose part of their title to respect, and of their tendency to
maintain right, whenever, either in civil or criminal questions, the mere
sentence of a judge is pronounced without explanation of its motives.</p>

<p>The fame of this renovated jurisprudence spread very rapidly from Italy
over other parts of Europe. Students flocked from all parts of Bologna;
and some eminent masters of that school repeated its lessons in distant
countries. One of these, Placentinus, explained the Digest at Montpelier
before the end of the twelfth century; and the collection of Justinian
soon came to supersede the Theodosian code in the dominions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
Toulouse.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Its study continued to flourish in the universities of both
these cities; and hence the Roman law, as it is exhibited in the system of
Justinian, became the rule of all tribunals in the southern provinces of
France. Its authority in Spain is equally great, or at least is only
disputed by that of the
canonists;<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
and it forms the acknowledged
basis of decision in all the Germanic tribunals, sparingly modified by the
ancient feudal customaries, which the jurists of the empire reduce within
narrow bounds.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
In the northern parts of France, where the legal
standard was sought in local customs, the civil law met naturally with
less regard. But the code of St. Louis borrows from that treasury many of
its provisions, and it was constantly cited in pleadings before the
parliament of Paris, either as obligatory by way of authority, or at least
as written wisdom, to which great deference was
shown.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
Yet its study was long prohibited in the university of Paris, front a disposition of the
popes to establish exclusively their decretals, though the prohibition was
silently disregarded.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its introduction into England.</div>

<p>As early as the reign of Stephen, Vacarius, a lawyer of Bologna, taught at
Oxford with great success; but the students of scholastic theology opposed
themselves, from some unexplained reason, to this new jurisprudence, and
his lectures were interdicted.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
About the time of Henry III. and
Edward I. the civil law acquired some credit in England; but a system
entirely incompatible with it had established itself in our courts of
justice; and the Roman jurisprudence was not only soon rejected, but
became obnoxious.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Every where, however, the clergy combined its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
study with that of their own canons; it was a maxim that every canonist
must be a civilian, and that no one could be a good civilian unless he
were also a canonist. In all universities, degrees are granted in both
laws conjointly; and in all courts of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the
authority of Justinian is cited, when that of Gregory or Clement is
wanting.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The elder civilians little regarded.</div>

<p>I should earn little gratitude for my obscure diligence, were I to dwell
on the forgotten teachers of a science that attracts so few. These elder
professors of Roman jurisprudence are infected, as we are told, with the
faults and ignorance of their time; failing in the exposition of ancient
law through incorrectness of manuscripts and want of subsidiary learning,
or perverting their sense through the verbal subtleties of scholastic
philosophy. It appears that, even a hundred years since, neither Azzo and
Accursius, the principal civilians of the thirteenth century, nor Bartolus
and Baldus, the more conspicuous luminaries of the next age, nor the later
writings of Accolti, Fulgosius, and Panormitanus, were greatly regarded as
authorities; unless it were in Spain, where improvement is always odious,
and the name of Bartolus inspired absolute
deference.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
In the sixteenth century, Alciatus and the greater Cujacius became, as it were,
the founders of a new and more enlightened academy of civil law, from
which the latter jurists derived their lessons. The laws of Justinian,
stripped of their impurer alloy, and of the tedious glosses of their
commentators, will form the basis of other systems, and mingling, as we
may hope, with the new institutions of philosophical legislators, continue
to influence the social relations of mankind, long after their direct
authority shall have been abrogated. The ruins of ancient Rome supplied
the materials of a new city; and the fragments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
of her law, which have
already been wrought into the recent codes of France and Prussia, will
probably, under other names, guide far distant generations by the sagacity
of Modestinus and Ulpian.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Public schools established by Charlemagne.</div>

<p>The establishment of public schools in France is owing to Charlemagne. At
his accession, we are assured that no means of obtaining a learned
education existed in his
dominions;<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
and in order to restore in some
degree the spirit of letters, he was compelled to invite strangers from
countries where learning was not so thoroughly extinguished. Alcuin of
England, Clement of Ireland, Theodulf of Germany, were the true Paladins
who repaired to his court. With the help of these he revived a few sparks
of diligence, and established schools in different cities of his empire;
nor was he ashamed to be the disciple of that in his own palace under the
care of Alcuin.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
His two next successors, Louis the Debonair and
Charles the Bald, were also encouragers of letters;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span> and the schools of
Lyons, Fulda, Corvey, Rheims, and some other cities, might be said to
flourish in the ninth century.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
In these were taught the trivium and
quadrivium, a long-established division of sciences: the first
comprehending grammar, or what we now call philology, logic, and rhetoric;
the second, music, arithmetic, geometry, and
astronomy.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
But in those ages scarcely anybody mastered the latter four; and to be perfect in the
three former was exceedingly rare. All those studies, however, were
referred to theology, and that in the narrowest manner; music, for
example, being reduced to church chanting, and astronomy to the
calculation of Easter.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
Alcuin was, in his old age, against reading
the poets;<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
and this discouragement of secular learning was very
general; though some, as for instance Raban, permitted a slight tincture
of it, as subsidiary to religious
instruction.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">University of Paris.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Abelard.</div>

<p>About the latter part of the eleventh century a greater ardour for
intellectual pursuits began to show itself in Europe, which in the twelfth
broke out into a flame. This was manifested in the numbers who repaired to
the public academies or schools of philosophy. None of these grew so early
into reputation as that of Paris. This cannot indeed, as has been vainly
pretended, trace its pedigree to Charlemagne. The first who is said to
have read lectures at Paris was Remigius of Auxerre, about the year
900.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
For the two next centuries the history of this school is very
obscure; and it would be hard to prove an unbroken continuity, or at least
a dependence and connexion of its professors. In the year 1100 we find
William of Champeaux teaching logic, and apparently some higher parts of
philosophy, with much credit. But this preceptor was eclipsed by his
disciple, afterwards his rival and adversary, Peter Abelard, to whose
brilliant and hardy genius the university of Paris appears to be indebted
for its rapid advancement. Abelard was almost the first who awakened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
mankind in the ages of darkness to a sympathy with intellectual
excellence. His bold theories, not the less attractive perhaps for
treading upon the bounds of heresy, his imprudent vanity, that scorned the
regularly acquired reputation of older men, allured a multitude of
disciples, who would never have listened to an ordinary teacher. It is
said that twenty cardinals and fifty bishops had been among his
hearers.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
Even in the wilderness, where he had erected the monastery
of Paraclete, he was surrounded by enthusiastic admirers, relinquishing
the luxuries, if so they might be called, of Paris, for the coarse living
and imperfect accommodation which that retirement could
afford.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> But
the whole of Abelard's life was the shipwreck of genius; and of genius,
both the source of his own calamities and unserviceable to posterity.
There are few lives of literary men more interesting or more diversified
by success and adversity, by glory and humiliation, by the admiration of
mankind and the persecution of enemies; nor from which, I may add, more
impressive lessons of moral prudence may be
derived.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
One of Abelard's pupils was Peter Lombard, afterwards archbishop of Paris, and author of a
work called the Book of Sentences, which obtained the highest authority
among the scholastic disputants. The resort of students to Paris became
continually greater; they appear, before the year 1169, to have been
divided into nations;<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
and probably they had an elected rector and
voluntary rules of discipline about the same time. This, however, is not
decisively proved; but in the last year of the twelfth century they
obtained their earliest charter from Philip
Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[m]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">University of Oxford.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
The opinion which ascribes the foundation of the university of Oxford to
Alfred, if it cannot be maintained as a truth, contains no intrinsic marks
of error. Ingulfus, abbot of Croyland, in the earliest authentic passage
that can be adduced to this point,<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
declares that he was sent from
Westminster to the school at Oxford, where he learned Aristotle, with the
first and second books of Tully's
Rhetoric.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> Since a school for
dialectics and rhetoric subsisted at Oxford, a town of but middling size
and not the seat of a bishop, we are naturally led to refer its foundation
to one of our kings, and none who had reigned after Alfred appears likely
to have manifested such zeal for learning. However, it is evident that the
school of Oxford was frequented under Edward the Confessor. There follows
an interval of above a century, during which we have, I believe, no
contemporary evidence of its continuance. But in the reign of Stephen,
Vacarius read lectures there upon civil law; and it is reasonable to
suppose that a foreigner would not have chosen that city, if he had not
found a seminary of learning already established. It was probably
inconsiderable, and might have been interrupted during some part of the
preceding century.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
In the reign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
of Henry II., or at least of Richard
I., Oxford became a very flourishing university, and in 1201, according to
Wood, contained 3000
scholars.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
The earliest charters were granted by John.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University of Bologna.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Encouragement given to universities.</div>

<p>If it were necessary to construe the word university in the strict sense
of a legal incorporation, Bologna might lay claim to a higher antiquity
than either Paris or Oxford. There are a few vestiges of studies pursued
in that city even in the eleventh
century;<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
but early in the next the
revival of the Roman jurisprudence, as has been already noticed, brought a
throng of scholars round the chairs of its professors. Frederic Barbarossa
in 1158, by his authentic, or rescript, entitled Habita, took these under
his protection, and permitted them to be tried in civil suits by their own
judges. This exemption from the ordinary tribunals, and even from those of
the church, was naturally coveted by other academies; it was granted to
the university of Paris by its earliest charter from Philip Augustus, and
to Oxford by John. From this time the golden age of universities
commenced; and it is hard to say whether they were favoured more by their
sovereigns or by the see of Rome. Their history indeed is full of
struggles with the municipal authorities, and with the bishops of their
several cities, wherein they were sometimes the aggressors, and generally
the conquerors. From all parts of Europe students resorted to these
renowned seats of learning with an eagerness for instruction which may
astonish those who reflect how little of what we now deem useful could be
imparted. At Oxford, under Henry III., it is said that there were 30,000
scholars; an exaggeration which seems to imply that the real number was
very great.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
A respectable contemporary writer asserts that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span> there
were full 10,000 at Bologna about the same
time.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
I have not observed any numerical statement as to Paris during this age; but there can be no
doubt that it was more frequented than any other. At the death of Charles
VII. in 1453, it is said to have contained 25,000
students.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[u]</a> In the
thirteenth century other universities sprang up in different countries;
Padua and Naples under the patronage of Frederic II., a zealous and useful
friend to letters,<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
Toulouse and Montpelier, Cambridge and
Salamanca.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
Orleans, which had long been distinguished as a school of
civil law, received the privileges of incorporation early in the
fourteenth century, and Angers before the expiration of the same
age.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
Prague, the earliest and most eminent of German universities, was founded
in 1350; a secession from thence of Saxon students, in consequence of the
nationality of the Bohemians and the Hussite schism, gave rise to that of
Leipsic.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
The fifteenth century produced several new academical
foundations in France and Spain.</p>

<p>A large proportion of scholars in most of those institutions were drawn by
the love of science from foreign countries. The chief universities had
their own particular departments of excellence. Paris was unrivalled for
scholastic theology; Bologna and Orleans, and afterwards Bourges, for
jurisprudence; Montpelier for medicine. Though national prejudices, as in
the case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
Prague, sometimes interfered with this free resort of
foreigners to places of education, it was in general a wise policy of
government, as well as of the universities themselves, to encourage it.
The thirty-fifth article of the peace of Bretigni provides for the
restoration of former privileges to students respectively in the French
and English universities.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
Various letters patent will be found in
Rymer's collection, securing to Scottish as well as French natives a safe
passage to their place of education. The English nation, including however
the Flemings and Germans,<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
had a separate vote in the faculty of arts
at Paris. But foreign students were not, I believe, so numerous in the
English academies.</p>

<p>If endowments and privileges are the means of quickening a zeal for
letters, they were liberally bestowed in the last three of the middle
ages. Crevier enumerates fifteen colleges founded in the university of
Paris during the thirteenth century, besides one or two of a still earlier
date. Two only, or at most three, existed in that age at Oxford, and but
one at Cambridge. In the next two centuries these universities could
boast, as every one knows, of many splendid foundations, though much
exceeded in number by those of Paris. Considered as ecclesiastical
institutions it is not surprising that the universities obtained,
according to the spirit of their age, an exclusive cognizance of civil or
criminal suits affecting their members. This jurisdiction was, however,
local as well as personal, and in reality encroached on the regular police
of their cities. At Paris the privilege turned to a flagrant abuse, and
gave rise to many scandalous contentions.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
Still more valuable advantages were those relating to ecclesiastical preferments, of which a
large proportion was reserved in France to academical graduates. Something
of the same sort, though less extensive, may still be traced in the rules
respecting plurality of benefices in our English church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of their celebrity.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Scholastic philosophy.</div>

<p>This remarkable and almost sudden transition from a total indifference to
all intellectual pursuits cannot be ascribed perhaps to any general
causes. The restoration of the civil, and the formation of the canon law,
were indeed eminently conducive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
to it, and a large proportion of scholars
in most universities confined themselves to jurisprudence. But the chief
attraction to the studious was the new scholastic philosophy. The love of
contention, especially with such arms as the art of dialectics supplies to
an acute understanding, is natural enough to mankind. That of speculating
upon the mysterious questions of metaphysics and theology is not less so.
These disputes and speculations, however, appear to have excited little
interest till, after the middle of the eleventh century, Roscelin, a
professor of logic, revived the old question of the Grecian schools
respecting universal ideas, the reality of which he denied. This kindled a
spirit of metaphysical discussion, which Lanfranc and Anselm, successively
archbishops of Canterbury, kept alive; and in the next century Abelard and
Peter Lombard, especially the latter, completed the scholastic system of
philosophizing. The logic of Aristotle seems to have been partly known in
the eleventh century, although that of Augustin was perhaps in higher
estimation;<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
in the twelfth it obtained more decisive influence. His
metaphysics, to which the logic might be considered as preparatory, were
introduced through translations from the Arabic, and perhaps also from the
Greek, early in the ensuing
century.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
This work, condemned at first by
the decrees of popes and councils on account of its supposed tendency to atheism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
acquired by degrees an influence, to which even popes and
councils were obliged to yield. The Mendicant Friars, established
throughout Europe in the thirteenth century, greatly contributed to
promote the Aristotelian philosophy; and its final reception into the
orthodox system of the church may chiefly be ascribed to Thomas Aquinas,
the boast of the Dominican order, and certainly the most distinguished
metaphysician of the middle ages. His authority silenced all scruple's as
to that of Aristotle, and the two philosophers were treated with equally
implicit deference by the later
schoolmen.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<p>This scholastic philosophy, so famous for several ages, has since passed
away and been forgotten. The history of literature, like that of empire,
is full of revolutions. Our public libraries are cemeteries of departed
reputation, and the dust accumulating upon their untouched volumes speaks
as forcibly as the grass that waves over the ruins of Babylon. Few, very
few, for a hundred years past, have broken the repose of the immense works
of the schoolmen. None perhaps in our own country have acquainted
themselves particularly with their contents. Leibnitz, however, expressed
a wish that some one conversant with modern philosophy would undertake to
extract the scattered particles of gold which may be hidden in their
abandoned mines. This wish has been at length partially fulfilled by three
or four of those industrious students and keen metaphysicians, who do
honour to modern Germany. But most of their works are unknown to me except
by repute, and as they all appear to be formed on a very extensive plan, I
doubt whether even those laborious men could afford adequate time for this
ungrateful research. Yet we cannot pretend to deny that Roscelin, Anselm,
Abelard, Peter Lombard, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and
Ockham, were men of acute and even profound understandings, the giants of
their own generation. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
with the slight knowledge we possess of their
tenets, there appear through the cloud of repulsive technical barbarisms
rays of metaphysical genius which this age ought not to despise. Thus in
the works of Anselm is found the celebrated argument of Des Cartes for the
existence of a Deity, deduced from the idea of an infinitely perfect
being. One great object that most of the schoolmen had in view was, to
establish the principles of natural theology by abstract reasoning. This
reasoning was doubtless liable to great difficulties. But a modern writer,
who seems tolerably acquainted with the subject, assures us that it would
be difficult to mention any theoretical argument to prove the divine
attributes, or any objection capable of being raised against the proof,
which we do not find in some of the scholastic
philosophers.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> The most
celebrated subjects of discussion, and those on which this class of
reasoners were most divided, were the reality of universal ideas,
considered as extrinsic to the human mind and the freedom of will. These
have not ceased to occupy the thoughts of
metaphysicians.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<p>But all discovery of truth by means of these controversies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
was rendered hopeless by two insurmountable obstacles, the authority of Aristotle and
that of the church. Wherever obsequious reverence is substituted for bold
inquiry, truth, if she is not already at hand, will never be attained. The
scholastics did not understand Aristotle, whose original writings they
could not read;<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
but his name was received with implicit faith. They
learned his peculiar nomenclature, and fancied that he had given them
realities. The authority of the church did them still more harm. It has
been said, and probably with much truth, that their metaphysics were
injurious to their theology. But I must observe in return that their
theology was equally injurious to their metaphysics. Their disputes
continually turned upon questions either involving absurdity and
contradiction, or at best inscrutable by human comprehension. Those who
assert the greatest antiquity of the Roman Catholic doctrine as to the
real presence, allow that both the word and the definition of
transubstantiation are owing to the scholastic writers. Their subtleties
were not always so well received. They reasoned at imminent peril of being
charged with heresy, which Roscelin, Abelard, Lombard, and Ockham did not
escape. In the virulent factions that arose out of their metaphysical
quarrels, either party was eager to expose its adversary to detraction and
persecution. The Nominalists were accused, one hardly sees why, with
reducing, like Sabellius, the persons of the Trinity to modal
distinctions. The Realists, with more pretence, incurred the imputation of
holding a language that savoured of
atheism.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
In the controversy which
the Dominicans and Franciscans, disciples respectively of Thomas Aquinas
and Duns Scotus, maintained about grace and freewill, it was of course still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
more easy to deal in mutual reproaches of heterodoxy. But the
schoolmen were in general prudent enough not to defy the censures of the
church; and the popes, in return for the support they gave to all
exorbitant pretensions of the Holy See, connived at this factious
wrangling, which threatened no serious mischief, as it did not proceed
from any independent spirit of research. Yet with all their apparent
conformity to the received creed, there was, as might be expected from the
circumstances, a great deal of real deviation from orthodoxy, and even of
infidelity. The scholastic mode of dispute, admitting of no termination
and producing no conviction, was the sure cause of scepticism; and the
system of Aristotle, especially with the commentaries of Averroes, bore an
aspect very unfavourable to natural
religion.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
The Aristotelian philosophy, even in the hands of the Master, was like a barren tree that
conceals its want of fruit by profusion of leaves. But the scholastic
ontology was much worse. What could be more trifling than disquisitions
about the nature of angels, their modes of operation, their means of
conversing, or (for these were distinguished) the morning and evening
state of their
understandings?<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
Into such follies the schoolmen appear
to have launched, partly because there was less danger of running against
a heresy in a matter where the church had defined so little&mdash;partly from
their presumption, which disdained all inquiries into the human mind, as
merely a part of physics&mdash;and in no small degree through a spirit of
mystical fanaticism, derived from the oriental philosophy and the later
Platonists, which blended itself with the cold-blooded technicalities of
the Aristotelian school.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
But this unproductive waste of the faculties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
could not last for ever. Men discovered that they had given
their time for the promise of wisdom, and been cheated in the bargain.
What John of Salisbury observes of the Parisian dialecticians in his own
time, that, after several years' absence, he found them not a step
advanced and still employed in urging and parrying the same arguments, was
equally applicable to the period of centuries. After three or four hundred
years, the scholastics had not untied a single knot, nor added one
unequivocal truth to the domain of philosophy. As this became more
evident, the enthusiasm for that kind of learning declined; after the
middle of the fourteenth century few distinguished teachers arose among
the schoolmen, and at the revival of letters their pretended science had
no advocates left, but among the prejudiced or ignorant adherents of
established systems. How different is the state of genuine philosophy, the
zeal for which will never wear out by length of time or change of fashion,
because the inquirer, unrestrained by authority, is perpetually cheered by
the discovery of truth in researches, which the boundless riches of nature
seem to render indefinitely
progressive!<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[q]</a></p>

<p>Yet, upon a general consideration, the attention paid in the universities
to scholastic philosophy, may be deemed a source of improvement in the
intellectual character, when we compare it with the perfect ignorance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
some preceding ages. Whether the same industry would not have been more
profitably directed if the love of metaphysics had not intervened, is
another question. Philology, or the principles of good taste, degenerated
through the prevalence of school-logic. The Latin compositions of the
twelfth century are better than those of the three that followed&mdash;at least
on the northern side of the Alps. I do not, however, conceive that any
real correctness of taste or general elegance of style was likely to
subsist in so imperfect a condition of society. These qualities seem to
require a certain harmonious correspondence in the tone of manners before
they can establish a prevalent influence over literature. A more real evil
was the diverting of studious men from mathematical science. Early in the
twelfth century several persons, chiefly English, had brought into Europe
some of the Arabian writings on geometry and physics. In the thirteenth
the works of Euclid were commented upon by
Campano,<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
and Roger Bacon was fully acquainted with
them.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Algebra, as far as the Arabians knew it, extending to quadratic equations, was actually in the hands of some
Italians at the commencement of the same age, and preserved for almost
three hundred years as a secret, though without any conception of its
importance. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
abstract mathematics require no collateral aid, they may
reach the highest perfection in ages of general barbarism; and there seems
to be no reason why, if the course of study had been directed that way,
there should not have arisen a Newton or a La Place, instead of an Aquinas
or an Ockham. The knowledge displayed by Roger Bacon and by Albertus
Magnus, even in the mixed mathematics, under every disadvantage from the
imperfection of instruments and the want of recorded experience, is
sufficient to inspire us with regret that their contemporaries were more
inclined to astonishment than to emulation. These inquiries indeed were
subject to the ordeal of fire, the great purifier of books and men; for if
the metaphysician stood a chance of being burned as a heretic, the natural
philosopher was in not less jeopardy as a
magician.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cultivation of the new languages.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Division of the Romance tongue into two dialects.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Troubadours of Provence.</div>

<p>A far more substantial cause of intellectual improvement was the
development of those new languages that sprang out of the corruption of
Latin. For three or four centuries after what was called the Romance
tongue was spoken in France, there remain but few vestiges of its
employment in writing; though we cannot draw an absolute inference from
our want of proof, and a critic of much authority supposes translations to
have been made into it for religious purposes from the time of
Charlemagne.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
During this period the language was split into two very
separate dialects, the regions of which may be considered, though by no
means strictly, as divided by the Loire. These were called the Langue
d'Oil and the Langue d'Oc; or in more modern terms, the French and
Proven√ßal dialects. In the latter of these I know of nothing which can
even by name be traced beyond the year 1100. About that time Gregory de
Bechada, a gentleman of Limousin, recorded the memorable events of the
first crusade, then recent, in a metrical history of great
length.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[x]</a> This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
poem has altogether perished; which, considering the popularity of
its subject, as M. Sismondi justly remarks, would probably not have been
the case if it had possessed any merit. But very soon afterwards a
multitude of poets, like a swarm of summer insects, appeared in the
southern provinces of France. These were the celebrated Troubadours, whose
fame depends far less on their positive excellence than on the darkness of
preceding ages, on the temporary sensation they excited, and their
permanent influence on the state of European poetry. From William count of
Poitou, the earliest troubadour on record, who died in 1126, to their
extinction, about the end of the next century, there were probably several
hundred of these versifiers in the language of Provence, though not always
natives of France. Millot has published the lives of one hundred and
forty-two, besides the names of many more whose history is unknown; and a
still greater number, it cannot be doubted, are unknown by name. Among
those poets are reckoned a king of England (Richard I.), two of Aragon,
one of Sicily, a dauphin of Auvergne, a count of Foix, a prince of Orange,
many noblemen and several ladies. One can hardly pretend to account for
this sudden and transitory love of verse; but it is manifestly one symptom
of the rapid impulse which the human mind received in the twelfth century,
and contemporaneous with the severer studies that began to flourish in the
universities. It was encouraged by the prosperity of Languedoc and
Provence, undisturbed, comparatively with other countries, by internal
warfare, and disposed by the temper of their inhabitants to feel with
voluptuous sensibility the charm of music and amorous poetry. But the
tremendous storm that fell upon Languedoc in the crusade against the
Albigeois shook off the flowers of Proven√ßal verse; and the final
extinction of the fief of Toulouse, with the removal of the counts of
Provence to Naples, deprived the troubadours of their most eminent
patrons. An attempt was made in the next century to revive them, by
distributing prizes for the best composition in the Floral Games of
Toulouse, which have sometimes been erroneously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
referred to a higher
antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
This institution perhaps still remains; but even in its
earliest period it did not establish the name of any Proven√ßal poet. Nor
can we deem these fantastical solemnities, styled Courts of Love, where
ridiculous questions of metaphysical gallantry were debated by poetical
advocates, under the presidency and arbitration of certain ladies, much
calculated to bring forward any genuine excellence. They illustrate,
however, what is more immediately my own object, the general ardour for
poetry and the manners of those chivalrous
ages.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[z]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Their poetical character.</div>

<p>The great reputation acquired by the troubadours, and panegyrics lavished
on some of them by Dante and Petrarch, excited a curiosity among literary
men, which has been a good deal disappointed by further acquaintance. An
excellent French antiquary of the last age, La Curne de St. Palaye, spent
great part of his life in accumulating manuscripts of Proven√ßal poetry,
very little of which had ever been printed. Translations from part of this
collection, with memorials of the writers, were published by Millot; and
we certainly do not often meet with passages in his three volumes which
give us any poetical
pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
Some of the original poems have since
been published, and the extracts made from them by the recent historians
of southern literature are rather superior. The troubadours chiefly
confined themselves to subjects of love, or rather gallantry, and to
satires (sirventes), which are sometimes keen and spirited. No romances of
chivalry, and hardly any tales, are found among their works. There seems a
general deficiency of imagination, and especially of that vivid
description which distinguishes works of genius in the rudest period of
society. In the poetry of sentiment, their favourite province, they seldom
attain any natural expression, and consequently produce no interest. I
speak, of course, on the presumption that the best specimens have been exhibited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
by those who have undertaken the task. It must be allowed,
however, that we cannot judge of the troubadours at a greater disadvantage
than through the prose translations of Millot. Their poetry was entirely
of that class which is allied to music, and excites the fancy or feelings
rather by the power of sound than any stimulancy of imagery and passion.
Possessing a flexible and harmonious language, they invented a variety of
metrical arrangements, perfectly new to the nations of Europe. The Latin
hymns were striking, but monotonous, the metre of the northern French
unvaried; but in Proven√ßal poetry, almost every length of verse, from two
syllables to twelve, and the most intricate disposition of rhymes, were at
the choice of the troubadour. The canzoni, the sestine, all the lyric
metres of Italy and Spain were borrowed from his treasury. With such a
command of poetical sounds, it was natural that he should inspire delight
into ears not yet rendered familiar to the artifices of verse; and even
now the fragments of these ancient lays, quoted by M. Sismondi and M.
Ginguen√©, seem to possess a sort of charm that has evaporated in
translation. Upon this harmony, and upon the facility with which mankind
are apt to be deluded into an admiration of exaggerated sentiment in
poetry, they depended for their influence. And however vapid the songs of
Provence may seem to our apprehensions, they were undoubtedly the source
from which poetry for many centuries derived a great portion of its
habitual language.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Northern French poetry and prose.</div>

<p>It has been maintained by some antiquaries, that the northern Romance, or
what we properly call French, was not formed until the tenth century, the
common dialect of all France having previously resembled that of
Languedoc. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
hypothesis may not be indisputable; but the question is
not likely to be settled, as scarcely any written specimens of Romance,
even of that age, have
survived.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
In the eleventh century, among other
more obscure productions, both in prose and metre, there appears what, if
unquestioned as to authenticity, would be a valuable monument of this
language; the laws of William the Conqueror. These are preserved in a
manuscript of Ingulfus's History of Croyland, a blank being left in other
copies where they should
be inserted.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
They are written in an idiom so
far removed from the Proven√ßal, that one would be disposed to think the
separation between these two species of Romance of older standing than is
commonly allowed. But it has been thought probable that these laws, which
in fact were nearly a repetition of those of Edward the Confessor, were
originally published in Anglo-Saxon, the only language intelligible to the
people, and translated, at a subsequent period, by some Norman monk into
French.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<p>The use of a popular language became more common after the year 1100.
Translations of some books of Scripture and acts of saints were made about
that time, or even earlier, and there are French sermons of St. Bernard,
from which extracts have been published, in the royal library at
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
In 1126, a charter was granted by Louis VI. to the city of
Beauvais in French.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
Metrical compositions are in general the first
literature of a nation, and even if no distinct proof could be adduced, we
might assume their existence before the twelfth century. There is however
evidence, not to mention the fragments printed by Le B&oelig;uf, of certain
lives of saints translated into French verse by Thibault de Vernon, a
canon of Rouen, before the middle of the preceding age. And we are told
that Taillefer, a Norman minstrel, recited a song or romance on the deeds
of Roland, before the army of his countrymen, at the battle of Hastings in
1066. Philip de Than, a Norman subject of Henry I., seems to be the
earliest poet whose works as well as name have reached us, unless we admit
a French, translation of the work of one Marbode upon precious stones to
be more ancient.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
This De Than wrote a set of rules for computation of
time and an account of different calendars. A happy theme for inspiration
without doubt! Another performance of the same author is a treatise on
birds and beasts, dedicated to Adelaide, queen of Henry
I.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> But a more
famous votary of the muses was Wace, a native of Jersey, who about the
beginning of Henry II.'s reign turned Geoffrey of Monmouth's history into
French metre. Besides this poem, called le Brut d'Angleterre, he composed
a series of metrical histories, containing the transactions of the dukes
of Normandy, from Rollo, their great progenitor, who gave name to the
Roman de Rou, down to his own age. Other productions are ascribed to Wace,
who was at least a prolific versifier, and, if he seem to deserve no
higher title at present, has a claim to indulgence, and even to esteem, as
having far excelled his contemporaries, without any superior advantages of
knowledge. In emulation, however, of his fame, several Norman writers
addicted themselves to composing chronicles, or devotional treatises in
metre. The court of our Norman kings was to the early poets in the Langue
d'Oil, what those of Arles and Toulouse were to the troubadours. Henry I.
was fond enough of literature to obtain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span> surname of Beauclerc; Henry
II. was more indisputably an encourager of poetry; and Richard I. has left
compositions of his own in one or other (for the point is doubtful) of the
two dialects spoken in France.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[k]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Norman romances and tales.</div>

<p>If the poets of Normandy had never gone beyond historical and religious
subjects, they would probably have had less claim to our attention than
their brethren of Provence. But a different and far more interesting
species of composition began to be cultivated in the latter part of the
twelfth century. Without entering upon the controverted question as to the
origin of romantic fictions, referred by one party to the Scandinavians,
by a second to the Arabs, by others to the natives of Britany, it is
manifest that the actual stories upon which one early and numerous class
of romances was founded are related to the traditions of the last people.
These are such as turn upon the fable of Arthur; for though we are not
entitled to deny the existence of such a personage, his story seems
chiefly the creation of Celtic vanity. Traditions current in Britany,
though probably derived from this island, became the basis of Geoffrey of
Monmouth's Latin prose, which, as has been seen, was transfused into
French metre by Wace.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
The vicinity of Normandy enabled its poets to
enrich their narratives with other Armorican fictions, all relating to the
heroes who had surrounded the table of the son of
Uther.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> An equally
imaginary history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
Charlemagne gave rise to a new family of romances.
The authors of these fictions were called Trouveurs, a name obviously
identical with that of Troubadours. But except in name there was no
resemblance between the minstrels of the northern and southern dialects.
The invention of one class was turned to description, that of the other to
sentiment; the first were epic in their form and style, the latter almost
always lyric. We cannot perhaps give a better notion of their
dissimilitude, than by saying that one school produced Chaucer, and the
other Petrarch. Besides these romances of chivalry, the trouveurs
displayed their powers of lively narration in comic tales or fabliaux, (a
name sometimes extended to the higher romance,) which have aided the
imagination of Boccace and La Fontaine. These compositions are certainly
more entertaining than those of the troubadours; but, contrary to what I
have said of the latter, they often gain by appearing in a modern dress.
Their versification, which doubtless had its charm when listened to around
the hearth of an ancient castle, is very languid and prosaic, and suitable
enough to the tedious prolixity into which the narrative is apt to fall;
and though we find many sallies of that arch and sprightly simplicity
which characterizes the old language of France as well as England, it
requires, upon the whole, a factitious taste to relish these Norman tales,
considered as poetry in the higher sense of the word, distinguished from
metrical fiction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman de la Rose.</div>

<p>A manner very different from that of the fabliaux was adopted, in the
Roman de la Rose, begun by William de Loris about 1250, and completed by
John de Meun half a century later. This poem, which contains about 16,000
lines in the usual octo-syllable verse, from which the early French
writers seldom deviated, is an allegorical vision, wherein, love and the
other passions or qualities connected with it pass over the stage, without
the intervention, I believe, of any less abstract personages. Though
similar allegories were not unknown to the ancients, and, which is more to
the purpose, maybe found in other productions of the thirteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span> century,
none had been constructed so elaborately as that of the Roman de la Rose.
Cold and tedious as we now consider this species of poetry, it originated
in the creative power of imagination, and appealed to more refined feeling
than the common metrical narratives could excite. This poem was highly
popular in the middle ages, and became the source of those numerous
allegories which had not ceased in the seventeenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Works in French prose.</div>

<p>The French language was employed in prose as well as in metre. Indeed it
seems to have had almost an exclusive privilege in this respect. "The
language of Oil," says Dante, in his treatise on vulgar speech, "prefers
its claim to be ranked above those of Oc and Si (Proven√ßal and Italian),
on the ground that all translations or compositions in prose have been
written therein, from its greater facility and grace, such as the books
compiled from the Trojan and Roman stories, the delightful fables about
Arthur, and many other works of history and
science."<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
I have mentioned already the sermons of St. Bernard and translations from
Scripture. The laws of the kingdom of Jerusalem purport to have been drawn
up immediately after the first crusade, and though their language has been
materially altered, there seems no doubt that they were originally
compiled in French.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
Besides some charters, there are said to have
been prose romances before the year
1200.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
Early in the next age Ville
Hardouin, seneschal of Campagne, recorded the capture of Constantinople in
the fourth crusade, an expedition, the glory and reward of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span> which he had
personally shared, and, as every original work of prior date has either
perished or is of small importance, may be deemed the father of French
prose. The Establishments of St. Louis, and the law treatise of
Beaumanoir, fill up the interval of the thirteenth century, and before its
conclusion we must suppose the excellent memoirs of Joinville to have been
composed, since they are dedicated to Louis X. in 1315, when the author
could hardly be less than ninety years of age. Without prosecuting any
further the history of French literature, I will only mention the
translations of Livy and Sallust, made in the reign and by the order of
John, with those of C√¶sar, Suetonius, Ovid, and parts of Cicero, which
are, due to his successor Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[r]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish language.</div>

<p>I confess myself wholly uninformed as to the original formation of the
Spanish language, and as to the epoch of its separation into the two
principal dialects of Castile and Portugal, or
Gallicia;<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
nor should I perhaps have alluded to the literature of that peninsula, were it not for
a remarkable poem which shines out among the minor lights of those times.
This is a metrical life of the Cid Ruy Diaz, written in a barbarous style
and with the rudest inequality of measure, but with a truly Homeric warmth
and vivacity of delineation. It is much to be regretted that the author's
name has perished; but its date has been referred by some to the middle of
the twelfth century, while the hero's actions were yet recent, and before
the taste of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
Spain had been corrupted by the Proven√ßal troubadours, whose
extremely different manner would, if it did not pervert the poet's genius,
at least have impeded his popularity. A very competent judge has
pronounced the poem of the Cid to be "decidedly and beyond comparison the
finest in the Spanish language." It is at least superior to any that was
written in Europe before the appearance of
Dante.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[t]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Early writers in the Italian.</div>

<p>A strange obscurity envelops the infancy of the Italian language. Though
it is certain that grammatical Latin had ceased to be employed in ordinary
discourse, at least from the time of Charlemagne, we have not a single
passage of undisputed authenticity, in the current idiom, for nearly four
centuries afterwards. Though Italian phrases are mixed up in the barbarous
jargon of some charters, not an instrument is extant in that language
before the year 1200, unless we may reckon one in the Sardinian dialect
(which I believe was rather Proven√ßal than Italian), noticed by
Muratori.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
Nor is there a vestige of Italian poetry older than a few
fragments of Ciullo d'Alcamo, a Sicilian, who must have written before
1193, since he mentions Saladin as then
living.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
This may strike us as
the more remarkable, when we consider the political circumstances of Italy
in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. From the struggles of her spirited
republics against the emperors and their internal factions, we might, upon
all general reasoning, anticipate the early use and vigorous cultivation
of their native language. Even if it were not yet ripe for historians and
philosophers, it is strange that no poet should have been inspired with
songs of triumph or invective by the various fortunes of his country. But,
on the contrary, the poets of Lombardy became troubadours, and wasted
their genius in Proven√ßal love strains at the courts of princes. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
Milanese and other Lombard dialects were, indeed, exceedingly rude; but
this rudeness separated them more decidedly from Latin: nor is it possible
that the Lombards could have employed that language intelligibly for any
public or domestic purpose. And indeed in the earliest Italian
compositions that have been published, the new language is so thoroughly
formed, that it is natural to infer a very long disuse of that from which
it was derived. The Sicilians claim the glory of having first adapted
their own harmonious dialect to poetry. Frederic II. both encouraged their
art and cultivated it; among the very first essays of Italian verse we
find his productions and those of his chancellor Piero delle Vigne. Thus
Italy was destined to owe the beginnings of her national literature to a
foreigner and an enemy. These poems are very short and few; those ascribed
to St. Francis about the same time are hardly distinguishable from prose;
but after the middle of the thirteenth century the Tuscan poets awoke to a
sense of the beauties which their native language, refined from the
impurities of vulgar
speech,<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
could display, and the genius of Italian
literature was rocked upon the restless waves of the Florentine democracy.
Ricordano Malespini, the first historian, and nearly the first prose
writer in Italian, left memorials of the republic down to the year 1281,
which was that of his death, and it was continued by Giacchetto Malespini
to 1286. These are little inferior in purity of style to the best Tuscan
authors; for it is the singular fate of that language to have spared
itself all intermediate stages of refinement, and, starting the last in
the race, to have arrived almost instantaneously at the goal. There is an
interval of not much more than half a century between the short fragment
of Ciullo d'Alcamo, mentioned above, and the poems of Guido Guinizzelli,
Guitone d'Arezzo, and Guido Cavalcante,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
which, in their diction and turn
of thought, are sometimes not unworthy of
Petrarch.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[z]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dante.</div>

<p>But at the beginning of the next age arose a much greater genius, the true
father of Italian poetry, and the first name in the literature of the
middle ages. This was Dante, or Durante Alighieri, born in 1265, of a
respectable family at Florence. Attached to the Guelf party, which had
then obtained a final ascendency over its rival, he might justly promise
himself the natural reward of talents under a free government, public
trust and the esteem of his compatriots. But the Guelfs unhappily were
split into two factions, the Bianchi and the Neri, with the former of
whom, and, as it proved, the unsuccessful side, Dante was connected. In
1300 he filled the office of one of the Priori, or chief magistrates at
Florence; and having manifested in this, as was alleged, some partiality
towards the Bianchi, a sentence of proscription passed against him about
two years afterwards, when it became the turn of the opposite faction to
triumph. Banished from his country, and baffled in several efforts of his
friends to restore their fortunes, he had no resource but at the courts of
the Scalas at Verona, and other Italian princes, attaching himself in
adversity to the Imperial interests, and tasting, in his own language, the
bitterness of another's bread.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
In this state of exile he finished, if
he did not commence, his great poem, the Divine Comedy; a representation
of the three kingdoms of futurity, Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, divided
into one hundred cantos, and containing about 14,000 lines. He died at
Ravenna in 1321.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
Dante is among the very few who have created the national poetry of their
country. For notwithstanding the polished elegance of some earlier Italian
verse, it had been confined to amorous sentiment; and it was yet to be
seen that the language could sustain, for a greater length than any
existing poem except the Iliad, the varied style of narration, reasoning,
and ornament. Of all writers he is the most unquestionably original.
Virgil was indeed his inspiring genius, as he declares himself, and as may
sometimes be perceived in his diction; but his tone is so peculiar and
characteristic, that few readers would be willing at first to acknowledge
any resemblance. He possessed, in an extraordinary degree, a command of
language, the abuse of which led to his obscurity and licentious
innovations. No poet ever excelled him in conciseness, and in the rare
talent of finishing his pictures by a few bold touches; the merit of
Pindar in his better hours. How prolix would the stories of Francesca or
of Ugolino have become in the hands of Ariosto, or of Tasso, or of Ovid,
or of Spenser! This excellence indeed is most striking in the first part
of his poem. Having formed his plan so as to give an equal length to the
three regions of his spiritual world, he found himself unable to vary the
images of hope or beatitude, and the Paradise is a continual accumulation
of descriptions, separately beautiful, but uniform and tedious. Though
images derived from light and music are the most pleasing, and can be
borne longer in poetry than any others, their sweetness palls upon the
sense by frequent repetition, and we require the intermixture of sharper
flavours. Yet there are detached passages of great excellence in this
third part of Dante's poem; and even in the long theological discussions
which occupy the greater proportion of its thirty-three cantos, it is
impossible not to admire the enunciation of abstract positions with
remarkable energy, conciseness, and sometimes perspicuity. The first
twelve cantos of the Purgatory are an almost continual flow of soft and
brilliant poetry. The last seven are also very splendid; but there is some
heaviness in the intermediate parts. Fame has justly given the preference
to the Inferno, which displays throughout a more vigorous and masterly
conception; but the mind of Dante cannot be thoroughly appreciated without
a perusal of his entire poem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
The most forced and unnatural turns, the most barbarous licences of idiom,
are found in this poet, whose power of expression is at other times so
peculiarly happy. His style is indeed generally free from those conceits
of thought which discredited the other poets of his country; but no sense
is too remote for a word which he finds convenient for his measure or his
rhyme. It seems indeed as if he never altered a line on account of the
necessity of rhyme, but forced another, or perhaps a third, into company
with it. For many of his faults no sufficient excuse can be made. But it
is candid to remember, that Dante, writing almost in the infancy of a
language which he contributed to create, was not to anticipate that words
which he borrowed from the Latin, and from the provincial dialects, would
by accident, or through the timidity of later writers, lose their place in
the classical idiom of Italy. If Petrarch, Bembo, and a few more, had not
aimed rather at purity than copiousness, the phrases which now appear
barbarous, and are at least obsolete, might have been fixed by use in
poetical language.</p>

<p>The great characteristic excellence of Dante is elevation of sentiment, to
which his compressed diction and the emphatic cadences of his measure
admirably correspond. We read him, not as an amusing poet, but as a master
of moral wisdom, with reverence and awe. Fresh from the deep and serious,
though somewhat barren studies of philosophy, and schooled in the severer
discipline of experience, he has made of his poem a mirror of his mind and
life, the register of his solicitudes and sorrows, and of the speculations
in which he sought to escape their recollection. The banished magistrate
of Florence, the disciple of Brunetto Latini, the statesman accustomed to
trace the varying fluctuations of Italian faction, is for ever before our
eyes. For this reason, even the prodigal display of erudition, which in an
epic poem would be entirely misplaced, increases the respect we feel for
the poet, though it does not tend to the reader's gratification. Except
Milton, he is much the most learned of all the great poets, and,
relatively to his age, far more learned than Milton. In one so highly
endowed by nature, and so consummate by instruction, we may well
sympathise with a resentment which exile and poverty rendered perpetually
fresh. The heart of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
Dante was naturally sensible, and even tender; his
poetry is full of simple comparisons from rural life; and the sincerity of
his early passion for Beatrice pierces through the veil of allegory which
surrounds her. But the memory of his injuries pursues him into the
immensity of eternal light; and, in the company of saints and angels, his
unforgiving spirit darkens at the name of
Florence.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<p>This great poem was received in Italy with that enthusiastic admiration
which attaches itself to works of genius only in ages too rude to listen
to the envy of competitors, or the fastidiousness of critics. Almost every
library in that country contains manuscript copies of the Divine Comedy,
and an account of those who have abridged or commented upon it would swell
to a volume. It was thrice printed in the year 1472, and at least nine
times within the fifteenth century. The city of Florence in 1373, with a
magnanimity which almost redeems her original injustice, appointed a
public professor to read lectures upon Dante; and it was hardly less
honourable to the poet's memory that the first person selected for this
office was Boccaccio. The universities of Pisa and Piacenza imitated this
example; but it is probable that Dante's abstruse philosophy was often
more regarded in their chairs than his higher
excellences.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> Italy
indeed, and all Europe, had reason to be proud of such a master. Since
Claudian, there had been seen for nine hundred years no considerable body
of poetry, except the Spanish poem of the Cid, of which no one had heard
beyond the peninsula, that could be said to pass mediocrity; and we must
go much further back than Claudian to find any one capable of being
compared with Dante. His appearance made an epoch in the intellectual
history of modern nations, and banished the discouraging suspicion which
long ages of lethargy tended to excite, that nature had exhausted her
fertility in the great poets of Greece and Rome. It was as if, at some of
the ancient games, a stranger had appeared upon the plain, and thrown his
quoit among the marks of former casts which tradition had ascribed to the
demigods. But the admiration of Dante, though it gave a general impulse to the human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
mind, did not produce imitators. I am unaware at least of any
writer, in whatever language, who can be said to have followed the steps
of Dante: I mean not so much in his subject as in the character of his
genius and style. His orbit is still all his own, and the track of his
wheels can never be confounded with that of a
rival.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[d]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Petrarch.</div>

<p>In the same year that Dante was expelled from Florence, a notary, by name
Petracco, was involved in a similar banishment. Retired to Arezzo, he
there became the father of Francis Petrarch. This great man shared of
course, during his early years, in the adverse fortune of his family,
which he was invincibly reluctant to restore, according to his father's
wish, by the profession of jurisprudence. The strong bias of nature
determined him to polite letters and poetry. These are seldom the
fountains of wealth; yet they would perhaps have been such to Petrarch, if
his temper could have borne the sacrifice of liberty for any worldly
acquisitions. At the city of Avignon, where his parents had latterly
resided, his graceful appearance and the reputation of his talents
attracted one of the Colonna family, then bishop of Lombes in Gascony. In
him, and in other members of that great house, never so illustrious as in
the fourteenth century, he experienced the union of patronage and
friendship. This, however, was not confined to the Colonnas. Unlike Dante,
no poet was ever so liberally and sincerely encouraged by the great; nor
did any perhaps ever carry to that perilous intercourse a spirit more
irritably independent, or more free from interested adulation. He praised
his friends lavishly because he loved them ardently; but his temper was
easily susceptible of offence, and there must have been much to tolerate
in that restlessness and jealousy of reputation which is perhaps the
inevitable failing of a
poet.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
But every thing was forgiven to a man who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
the acknowledged boast of his age and country. Clement VI.
conferred one or two sinecure benefices upon Petrarch, and would probably
have raised him to a bishopric if he had chosen to adopt the
ecclesiastical profession. But he never took orders, the clerical tonsure
being a sufficient qualification for holding canonries. The same pope even
afforded him the post of apostolical secretary, and this was repeated by
Innocent VI. I know not whether we should ascribe to magnanimity or to a
politic motive the behaviour of Clement VI. towards Petrarch, who had
pursued a course as vexatious as possible to the Holy See. For not only he
made the residence of the supreme pontiffs at Avignon, and the vices of
their court, the topic of invectives, too well founded to be despised, but
he had ostentatiously put himself forward as the supporter of Nicola di
Rienzi in a project which could evidently have no other aim than to wrest
the city of Rome from the temporal sovereignty of its bishop. Nor was the
friendship and society of Petrarch less courted by the most respectable
Italian princes; by Robert king of Naples, by the Visconti, the Correggi
of Parma, the famous doge of Venice, Andrew Dandolo, and the Carrara
family of Padua, under whose protection he spent the latter years of his
life. Stories are related of the respect shown to him by men in humbler
stations which are perhaps still more
satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
But the most conspicuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
testimony of public esteem was bestowed by the city of Rome,
in his solemn coronation as laureat poet in the Capitol. This ceremony
took place in 1341; and it is remarkable that Petrarch had at that time
composed no works which could, in our estimation, give him pretensions to
so singular an honour.</p>

<p>The moral character of Petrarch was formed of dispositions peculiarly
calculated for a poet. An enthusiast in the emotions of love and
friendship, of glory, of patriotism, of religion, he gave the rein to all
their impulses; and there is not perhaps a page in his Italian writing
which does not bear the trace of one or other of these affections. By far
the most predominant, and that which has given the greatest celebrity to
his name, is his passion for Laura. Twenty years of unrequited and almost
unaspiring love were lightened by song; and the attachment, which, having
long survived the beauty of its
object,<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
seems to have at one time
nearly passed from the heart to the fancy, was changed to an intenser
feeling, and to a sort of celestial adoration, by her death. Laura, before
the time of Petrarch's first accidental meeting with her, was united in
marriage with another; a fact which, besides some more particular
evidence, appears to me deducible from the whole tenor of his
poetry.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
Such a passion is undoubtedly not capable of a moral defence; nor would I
seek its palliation so much in the prevalent manners of his age, by which
however the conduct of even good men is generally not a little influenced,
as in the infirmity of Petrarch's character, which induced him both to
obey and to justify the emotions of his heart. The lady too, whose virtue
and prudence we are not to question, seems to have tempered the light and
shadow of her countenance so as to preserve her admirer from despair, and
consequently to prolong his sufferings and servitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
The general excellences of Petrarch, are his command over the music of
his native language, his correctness of style, scarcely two or three words
that he has used having been rejected by later writers, his exquisite
elegance of diction, improved by the perpetual study of Virgil; but, far
above all, that tone of pure and melancholy sentiment which has something
in it unearthly, and forms a strong contrast to the amatory poems of
antiquity. Most of these are either licentious or uninteresting; and those
of Catullus, a man endowed by nature with deep and serious sensibility,
and a poet, in my opinion, of greater and more varied genius than
Petrarch, are contaminated above all the rest with the most degrading
grossness. Of this there is not a single instance in the poet of Vaucluse;
and his strains, diffused and admired as they have been, may have
conferred a benefit that criticism cannot estimate, in giving elevation
and refinement to the imaginations of youth. The great defect of Petrarch
was his want of strong original conception, which prevented him from
throwing off the affected and overstrained manner of the Proven√ßal
troubadours, and of the earlier Italian poets. Among his poems the
Triumphs are perhaps superior to the Odes, as the latter are to the
Sonnets; and of the latter, those written subsequently to the death of
Laura are in general the best. But that constrained and laborious measure
cannot equal the graceful flow of the canzone, or the vigorous compression
of the terza rima. The Triumphs have also a claim to superiority, as the
only poetical composition of Petrarch that extends to any considerable
length. They are in some degree perhaps an imitation of the dramatic
Mysteries, and form at least the earliest specimens of a kind of poetry
not uncommon in later times, wherein real and allegorical personages are
intermingled in a masque or scenic
representation.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[i]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">English language.</div>

<p>None of the principal modern languages was so late in its formation, or in
its application to the purposes of literature, as the English. This arose,
as is well known, out of the Saxon branch of the Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span> Teutonic stock
spoken in England till after the Conquest. From this mother dialect our
English differs less in respect of etymology, than of syntax, idiom, and
flexion. In so gradual a transition as probably took place, and one so
sparingly marked by any existing evidence, we cannot well assign a
definite origin to our present language. The question of identity is
almost as perplexing in languages as in individuals. But, in the reign of
Henry II., a version of Wace's poem of Brut, by one Layamon, a priest of
Ernly-upon-Severn, exhibits as it were the chrysalis of the English
language, in a very corrupt modification of the
Anglo-Saxon.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Very soon afterwards the new formation was better developed; and some metrical
pieces, referred by critics to the earlier part of the thirteenth century,
differ but little from our legitimate
grammar.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
About the beginning of
Edward I.'s reign, Robert, a monk of Gloucester, composed a metrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
chronicle from the history of Geoffrey of Monmouth, which he continued to
his own time. This work, with a similar chronicle of Robert Manning, a
monk of Brunne (Bourne) in Lincolnshire, nearly thirty years later, stand
at the head of our English poetry. The romance of Sir Tristrem, ascribed
to Thomas of Erceldoune, surnamed the Rhymer, a Scottish minstrel, has
recently laid claim to somewhat higher
antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> In the fourteenth
century a great number of metrical romances were translated from the
French. It requires no small portion of indulgence to speak favourably of
any of these early English productions. A poetical line may no doubt
occasionally be found; but in general the narration is as heavy and prolix
as the versification is unmusical.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
The first English writer who can
be read with approbation is William Langland, the author of Piers
Plowman's Vision, a severe satire upon the clergy. Though his measure is
more uncouth than that of his predecessors, there is real energy in his
conceptions, which he caught not from the chimeras of knight-errantry, but
the actual manners and opinions of his time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cause of its slow progress.</div>

<p>The very slow progress of the English language, as an instrument of
literature, is chiefly to be ascribed to the effects of the Norman
conquest, in degrading the native inhabitants and transferring all power
and riches to foreigners. The barons, without perhaps one exception, and a
large proportion of the gentry, were of French descent, and preserved
among themselves the speech of their fathers. This continued much longer
than we should naturally have expected; even after the loss of Normandy
had snapped the thread of French connexions, and they began to pride
themselves in the name of Englishmen, and in the inheritance of
traditionary English privileges. Robert of Gloucester has a remarkable
passage, which proves that in his time, somewhere about 1290, the superior
ranks continued to use the French
language.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[p]</a> Ralph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span> Higden, about the
early part of Edward III.'s reign, though his expressions do not go the
same length, asserts, that "gentlemen's children are taught to speak
French, from the time they are rocked in their cradle; and uplandish
(country) or inferior men will liken themselves to gentlemen, and learn
with great business for to speak French, for to be the more told of."
Notwithstanding, however, this predominance of French among the higher
class, I do not think that some modern critics are warranted in concluding
that they were in general ignorant of the English tongue. Men living upon
their estates among their tenantry, whom they welcomed in their halls, and
whose assistance they were perpetually needing in war and civil frays,
would hardly have permitted such a barrier to obstruct their intercourse.
For we cannot, at the utmost, presume that French was so well known to the
English commonalty in the thirteenth century as English is at present to
the same class in Wales and the Scottish Highlands. It may be remarked
also, that the institution of trial by jury must have rendered a knowledge
of English almost indispensable to those who administered justice. There
is a proclamation of Edward I. in Rymer, where he endeavours to excite his
subjects against the king of France by imputing to him the intention of
conquering the country and abolishing the English language (linguam delere
Anglicanam), and this is frequently repeated in the proclamations of
Edward III.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
In his time, or perhaps a little before, the native
language had become more familiar than French in common use, even with the
court and nobility. Hence the numerous translations of metrical romances,
which are chiefly referred to his reign. An important change was effected
in 1362 by a statute, which enacts that all pleas in courts of justice
shall be pleaded, debated, and judged in English. But Latin was by this
act to be employed in drawing the record; for there seems to have still
continued a sort of prejudice against the use of English as a written
language. The earliest English instrument known to exist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> is said to bear
the date of 1343.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[r]</a>
And there are but few entries in our own tongue
upon the rolls of parliament before the reign of Henry VI., after whose
accession its use becomes very
common.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Sir John Mandevile, about
1356, may pass for the father of English prose, no original work being so
ancient as his Travels. But the translation of the Bible and other
writings by Wicliffe, nearly thirty years afterwards, taught us the
copiousness and energy of which our native dialect was capable; and it was
employed in the fifteenth century by two writers of distinguished merit,
Bishop Pecock and Sir John Fortescue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chaucer.</div>

<p>But the principal ornament of our English literature was Geoffrey Chaucer,
who, with Dante and Petrarch, fills up the triumvirate of great poets in
the middle ages. Chaucer was born in 1328, and his life extended to the
last year of the fourteenth century. That rude and ignorant generation was
not likely to feel the admiration of native genius as warmly as the
compatriots of Petrarch; but he enjoyed the favour of Edward III., and
still more conspicuously of John duke of Lancaster; his fortunes were far
more prosperous than have usually been the lot of poets; and a reputation
was established beyond competition in his lifetime, from which no
succeeding generation has withheld its sanction. I cannot, in my own
taste, go completely along with the eulogies that some have bestowed upon
Chaucer, who seems to me to have wanted grandeur, where he is original,
both in conception and in language. But in vivacity of imagination and
ease of expression, he is above all poets of the middle time, and
comparable perhaps to the greatest of those who have followed. He
invented, or rather introduced from France, and employed with facility the
regular iambic couplet; and though it was not to be expected that he
should perceive the capacities latent in that measure, his versification,
to which he accommodated a very licentious and arbitrary pronunciation, is
uniform and harmonious.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[t]</a> It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span> chiefly, indeed, as a comic poet, and
a minute observer of manners and circumstances, that Chaucer excels. In
serious and moral poetry he is frequently languid and diffuse; but he
springs like Ant√¶us from the earth, when his subject changes to coarse
satire, or merry narrative. Among his more elevated compositions, the
Knight's Tale is abundantly sufficient to immortalize Chaucer, since it
would be difficult to find any where a story better conducted, or told
with more animation and strength of fancy. The second place may be given
to his Troilus and Creseide, a beautiful and interesting poem, though
enfeebled by expansion. But perhaps the most eminent, or at any rate the
most characteristic testimony to his genius will be found in the prologue
to his Canterbury Tales; a work entirely and exclusively his own, which
can seldom be said of his poetry, and the vivid delineations of which
perhaps very few writers but Shakspeare could have equalled. As the first
original English poet, if we except Langland, as the inventor of our most
approved measure, as an improver, though with too much innovation, of our
language, and as a faithful witness to the manners of his age, Chaucer
would deserve our reverence, if he had not also intrinsic claims for
excellences, which do not depend upon any collateral considerations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revival of ancient learning.</div>

<div class="sidenote">In the twelfth century;</div>

<p>The last circumstance which I shall mention, as having contributed to
restore society from the intellectual degradation into which it had fallen
during the dark ages, is the revival of classical learning. The Latin
language indeed, in which all legal instruments were drawn up, and of
which all ecclesiastics availed themselves in their epistolary
intercourse, as well as in their more solemn proceedings, had never ceased
to be familiar. Though many solecisms and barbarous words occur in the
writings of what were called learned men, they possessed a fluency of
expression in Latin which does not often occur at present. During the dark
ages, however, properly so called, or the period from the sixth to the
eleventh century, we chiefly meet with quotations from the Vulgate or from
theological writers. Nevertheless, quotations from the Latin poets are
hardly to be called unusual. Virgil, Ovid, Statius, and Horace, are
brought forward by those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
who aspired to some literary reputation,
especially during the better periods of that long twilight, the reigns of
Charlemagne and his son in France, part of the tenth century in Germany,
and the eleventh in both. The prose writers of Rome are not so familiar,
but in quotations we are apt to find the poets preferred; and it is
certain that a few could be named who were not ignorant of Cicero,
Sallust, and Livy. A considerable change took place in the course of the
twelfth century. The polite literature, as well as the abstruser science
of antiquity, became the subject of cultivation. Several writers of that
age, in different parts of Europe, are distinguished more or less for
elegance, though not absolute purity of Latin style; and for their
acquaintance with those ancients, who are its principal models. Such were
John of Salisbury, the acute and learned author of the Polycraticon,
William of Malmsbury, Giraldus Cambrensis, Roger Hoveden, in England; and
in foreign countries, Otho of Frisingen, Saxo Grammaticus, and the best
perhaps of all I have named as to style, Falcandus, the historian of
Sicily. In these we meet with frequent quotations from Livy, Cicero,
Pliny, and other considerable writers of antiquity. The poets were now
admired and even imitated. All metrical Latin before the latter part of
the twelfth century, so far as I have seen, is of little value; but at
this time, and early in the succeeding age, there appeared several
versifiers who aspired to the renown of following the steps of Virgil and
Statius in epic poetry. Joseph Iscanus, an Englishman, seems to have been
the earliest of these; his poem on the Trojan war containing an address to
Henry II. He wrote another, entitled Antiocheis, on the third crusade,
most of which has perished. The wars of Frederic Barbarossa were
celebrated by Gunther in his Ligurinus; and not long afterwards,
Guillelmus Brito wrote the Philippis, in honour of Philip Augustus, and
Walter de Chatillon the Alexandreis, taken from the popular romance of
Alexander. None of these poems, I believe, have much intrinsic merit; but
their existence is a proof of taste that could relish, though not of
genius that could emulate
antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[u]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">much more the fourteenth.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Invention of linen paper.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Libraries.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
In the thirteenth century there seems to have been some decline of
classical literature, in consequence probably of the scholastic
philosophy, which was then in its greatest vigour; at least we do not find
so many good writers as in the preceding age. But about the middle of the
fourteenth, or perhaps a little sooner, an ardent zeal for the restoration
of ancient learning began to display itself. The copying of books, for
some ages slowly and sparingly performed in monasteries, had already
become a branch of trade;<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[x]</a>
and their price was consequently reduced.
Tiraboschi denies that the invention of making paper from linen rags is
older than the middle of that century; and although doubts may be justly
entertained as to the accuracy of this position, yet the confidence with
which so eminent a scholar advances it is at least a proof that paper
manuscripts of an earlier date are very
rare.<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[y]</a>
Princes became far more attentive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
to literature when it was no longer confined to metaphysical
theology and canon law. I have already mentioned the translations from
classical authors, made by command of John and Charles V. of France. These
French translations diffused some acquaintance with ancient history and
learning among our own countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
The public libraries assumed a
more respectable appearance. Louis IX. had formed one at Paris, in which
it does not appear that any work of elegant literature was
found.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> At
the beginning of the fourteenth century, only four classical manuscripts
existed in this collection; of Cicero, Ovid, Lucan, and
Boethius.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> The
academical library of Oxford, in 1300, consisted of a few tracts kept in
chests under St Mary's church. That of Glastonbury Abbey, in 1240,
contained four hundred volumes, among which were Livy, Sallust, Lucan,
Virgil, Claudian, and other ancient
writers.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
But no other, probably,
of that age was so numerous or so valuable. Richard of Bury, chancellor of
England, and Edward III., spared no expense in collecting a library, the
first perhaps that any private man had formed. But the scarcity of
valuable books was still so great, that he gave the abbot of St. Albans
fifty pounds weight of silver for between thirty and forty
volumes.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
Charles V.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
increased the royal library at Paris to nine hundred volumes,
which the duke of Bedford purchased and transported to
London.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> His
brother Humphrey duke of Gloucester presented the university of Oxford
with six hundred books, which seem to have been of extraordinary value,
one hundred and twenty of them having been estimated at one thousand
pounds. This indeed was in 1440, at which time such a library would not
have been thought remarkably numerous beyond the
Alps,<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> but England
had made comparatively little progress in learning. Germany, however, was
probably still less advanced. Louis, Elector Palatine, bequeathed in 1421
his library to the university of Heidelberg, consisting of one hundred and
fifty-two volumes. Eighty-nine of these related to theology, twelve to
canon and civil law, forty-five to medicine, and six to
philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Transcription of manuscripts.</div>

<p>Those who first undertook to lay open the stores of ancient learning found
incredible difficulties from the scarcity of manuscripts. So gross and
supine was the ignorance of the monks, within whose walls these treasures
were concealed, that it was impossible to ascertain, except by
indefatigable researches, the extent of what had been saved out of the
great shipwreck of antiquity. To this inquiry Petrarch devoted continual
attention. He spared no means to preserve the remains of authors, who were
perishing from neglect and time. This danger was by no means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span> passed in
the fourteenth century. A treatise of Cicero upon Glory, which had been in
his possession, was afterwards irretrievably
lost.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> He declares that
he had seen in his youth the works of Varro; but all his endeavours to
recover these and the second Decad of Livy were fruitless. He found,
however, Quintilian, in 1350, of which there was no copy in
Italy.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
Boccaccio, and a man of less general fame, Colluccio Salutato, were
distinguished in the same honourable task. The diligence of these scholars
was not confined to searching for manuscripts. Transcribed by slovenly
monks, or by ignorant persons who made copies for sale, they required the
continual emendation of accurate
critics.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
Though much certainly was
left for the more enlightened sagacity of later times, we owe the first
intelligible text of the Latin classics to Petrarch, Poggio, and their
contemporary labourers in this vineyard for a hundred years before the
invention of printing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Industry of the fifteenth century.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Poggio.</div>

<p>What Petrarch began in the fourteenth century was carried on by a new
generation with unabating industry. The whole lives of Italian scholars in
the fifteenth century were devoted to the recovery of manuscripts and the
revival of philology. For this they sacrificed their native language,
which had made such surprising shoots in the preceding age, and were
content to trace, in humble reverence, the footsteps of antiquity. For
this too they lost the hope of permanent glory, which can never remain
with imitators, or such as trim the lamp of ancient sepulchres. No writer
perhaps of the fifteenth century, except Politian, can aspire at present
even to the second class, in a just marshalling of literary reputation.
But we owe them our respect and gratitude for their taste and diligence.
The discovery of an unknown manuscript, says Tiraboschi, was regarded
almost as the conquest of a kingdom. The classical writers, he adds, were
chiefly either found in Italy, or at least by Italians; they were first
amended and first printed in Italy, and in Italy they were first collected
in public libraries.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
This is subject to some exception, when fairly
considered; several ancient authors were never lost, and therefore cannot
be said to have been discovered; and we know that Italy did not always
anticipate other countries in classical printing. But her superior merit
is incontestable. Poggio Bracciolini, who stands perhaps at the head of
the restorers of learning, in the earlier part of the fifteenth century,
discovered in the monastery of St. Gall, among dirt and rubbish in a
dungeon scarcely fit for condemned criminals, as he describes it, an
entire copy of Quintilian, and part of Valerius Flaccus. This was in 1414;
and soon afterwards, he rescued the poem of Silius Italicus, and twelve
comedies of Plautus, in addition to eight that were previously known:
besides Lucretius, Columella, Tertullian, Ammianus Marcellinus, and other
writers of inferior note.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
A bishop of Lodi brought to light the
rhetorical treatises of Cicero. Not that we must suppose these books to
have been universally unknown before; Quintilian, at least, is quoted by
English writers much earlier. But so little intercourse prevailed among
different countries, and the monks had so little acquaintance with the
riches of their conventual libraries, that an author might pass for lost
in Italy, who was familiar to a few learned men in other parts of Europe.
To the name of Poggio we may add a number of others, distinguished in this
memorable resurrection of ancient literature, and united, not always
indeed by friendship, for their bitter animosities disgrace their
profession, but by a sort of common sympathy in the cause of learning;
Filelfo, Laurentius Valla, Niccolo Niccoli, Ambrogio Traversari, more
commonly called Il Camaldolense, and Leonardo Aretino.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greek language unknown in the West.</div>

<p>From the subversion of the Western Empire, or at least from the time when
Rome ceased to pay obedience to the exarchs of Ravenna, the Greek language
and literature had been almost entirely forgotten within the pale of the
Latin church. A very few exceptions might be found, especially in the
earlier period of the middle ages, while the eastern emperors retained
their dominion over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
part of Italy.<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>
Thus Charlemagne is said to have
established a school for Greek at
Osnaburg.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[p]</a>
John Scotus seems to have
been well acquainted with the language. And Greek characters may
occasionally, though very seldom, be found in the writings of learned men;
such as Lanfranc or William of
Malmsbury.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[q]</a>
It is said that Roger Bacon
understood Greek; and that his eminent contemporary, Robert Grostete,
bishop of Lincoln, had a sufficient intimacy with it to translate a part
of Suidas. Since Greek was spoken with considerable purity by the noble
and well educated natives of Constantinople, we may wonder that, even as a
living language, it was not better known by the western nations, and
especially in so neighbouring a nation as Italy. Yet here the ignorance
was perhaps even more complete than in France or England. In some parts
indeed of Calabria, which had been subject to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span> eastern empire till
near the year 1100, the liturgy was still performed in Greek; and a
considerable acquaintance with the language was of course preserved. But
for the scholars of Italy, Boccaccio positively asserts, that no one
understood so much as the Greek
characters.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[r]</a> Nor is there probably a
single line quoted from any poet in that language from the sixth to the
fourteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its study revives in the fourteenth century.</div>

<p>The first to lead the way in restoring Grecian learning in Europe were the
same men who had revived the kindred muses of Latium, Petrarch and
Boccaccio. Barlaam, a Calabrian by birth, during an embassy from the court
of Constantinople in 1335, was persuaded to become the preceptor of the
former, with whom he read the works of
Plato.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[s]</a>
Leontius Pilatus, a
native of Thessalonica, was encouraged some years afterwards by Boccaccio
to give public lectures upon Homer at
Florence.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[t]</a>
Whatever might be the
share of general attention that he excited, he had the honour of
instructing both these great Italians in his native language. Neither of
them perhaps reached an advanced degree of proficiency; but they bathed
their lips in the fountain, and enjoyed the pride of being the first who
paid the homage of a new posterity to the father of poetry. For some time
little fruit apparently resulted from their example; but Italy had imbibed
the desire of acquisitions in a new sphere of knowledge, which, after some
interval, she was abundantly able to realize. A few years before the
termination of the fourteenth century, Emanuel Chrysoloras, whom the
emperor John Pal√¶ologus had previously sent into Italy, and even as far as
England, upon one of those unavailing embassies, by which the Byzantine
court strove to obtain sympathy and succour from Europe, returned to
Florence as a public teacher of Grecian
literature.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[u]</a>
His school was afterwards removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
successively to Pavia, Venice, and Rome; and during
nearly twenty years that he taught in Italy, most of those eminent
scholars whom I have already named, and who distinguish the first half of
that century, derived from his instruction their knowledge of the Greek
tongue. Some, not content with being the disciples of Chrysoloras, betook
themselves to the source of that literature at Constantinople; and
returned to Italy, not only with a more accurate insight into the Greek
idiom than they could have attained at home, but with copious treasures of
manuscripts, few, if any, of which probably existed previously in Italy,
where none had ability to read or value them; so that the principal
authors of Grecian antiquity may be considered as brought to light by
these inquirers, the most celebrated of whom are Guarino of Verona,
Aurispa, and Filelfo. The second of these brought home to Venice in 1423
not less than two hundred and thirty-eight
volumes.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[x]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">State of learning in Greece.</div>

<p>The fall of that eastern empire, which had so long outlived all other
pretensions to respect that it scarcely retained that founded upon its
antiquity, seems to have been providentially delayed till Italy was ripe
to nourish the scattered seeds of literature that would have perished a
few ages earlier in the common catastrophe. From the commencement of the
fifteenth century even the national pride of Greece could not blind her to
the signs of approaching ruin. It was no longer possible to inspire the
European republic, distracted by wars and restrained by calculating
policy, with the generous fanaticism of the crusades; and at the council
of Florence, in 1439, the court and church of Constantinople had the
mortification of sacrificing their long-cherished faith, without
experiencing any sensible return of protection or security. The learned
Greeks were perhaps the first to anticipate, and certainly not the last to
avoid, their country's destruction. The council of Florence brought many
of them into Italian connexions, and held out at least a temporary
accommodation of their conflicting opinions. Though the Roman pontiffs did
nothing, and probably could have done nothing effectual,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span> for the empire
of Constantinople, they were very ready to protect and reward the learning
of individuals. To Eugenius IV., to Nicolas V., to Pius II., and some
other popes of this age, the Greek exiles were indebted for a patronage
which they repaid by splendid services in the restoration of their native
literature throughout Italy. Bessarion, a disputant on the Greek side in
the council of Florence, was well content to renounce the doctrine of
single procession for a cardinal's hat&mdash;a dignity which he deserved for
his learning, if not for his pliancy. Theodore Gaza, George of Trebizond,
and Gemistus Pletho, might equal Bessarion in merit, though not in
honours. They all, however, experienced the patronage of those admirable
protectors of letters, Nicolas V., Cosmo de' Medici, or Alfonso king of
Naples. These men emigrated before the final destruction of the Greek
empire; Lascaris and Musurus, whose arrival in Italy was posterior to that
event, may be deemed perhaps still more conspicuous; but as the study of
the Greek language was already restored, it is unnecessary to pursue the
subject any further.</p>

<p>The Greeks had preserved, through the course of the middle ages, their
share of ancient learning with more fidelity and attention than was shown
in the west of Europe. Genius indeed, or any original excellence, could
not well exist along with their cowardly despotism, and their contemptible
theology, more corrupted by frivolous subtleties than that of the Latin
church. The spirit of persecution, naturally allied to despotism and
bigotry, had nearly, during one period, extinguished the lamp, or at least
reduced the Greeks to a level with the most ignorant nations of the West.
In the age of Justinian, who expelled the last Platonic philosophers,
learning began rapidly to decline; in that of Heraclius it had reached a
much lower point of degradation; and for two centuries, especially while
the worshippers of images were persecuted with unrelenting intolerance,
there is almost a blank in the annals of Grecian
literature.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[y]</a> But
about the middle of the ninth century it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span> revived pretty suddenly, and
with considerable
success.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[z]</a>
Though, as I have observed, we find in
very few instances any original talent, yet it was hardly less important
to have had compilers of such erudition as Photius, Suidas, Eustathius,
and Tzetzes. With these certainly the Latins of the middle ages could not
place any names in comparison. They possessed, to an extent which we
cannot precisely appreciate, many of those poets, historians, and orators
of ancient Greece, whose loss we have long regretted and must continue to
deem irretrievable. Great havoc, however, was made in the libraries of
Constantinople at its capture by the Latins&mdash;an epoch from which a rapid
decline is to be traced in the literature of the eastern empire. Solecisms
and barbarous terms, which sometimes occur in the old Byzantine writers,
are said to deform the style of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
The Turkish ravages and destruction of monasteries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
ensued; and in the cheerless intervals of immediate terror there was no
longer any encouragement to preserve the monuments of an expiring
language, and of a name that was to lose its place among
nations.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[b]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Literature not much improved beyond Italy.</div>

<p>That ardour for the restoration of classical literature which animated
Italy in the first part of the fifteenth century, was by no means common
to the rest of Europe. Neither England, nor France, nor Germany, seemed
aware of the approaching change. We are told that learning, by which I

Oxford from the time of Edward
III.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
And the fifteenth century, from
whatever cause, is particularly barren of writers in the Latin language.
The study of Greek was only introduced by Grocyn and Linacer under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span> Henry
VII., and met with violent opposition in the university of Oxford, where
the unlearned party styled themselves Trojans, as a pretext for abusing
and insulting the scholars.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
Nor did any classical work proceed from
the respectable press of Caxton. France, at the beginning of the fifteenth
age, had several eminent theologians; but the reigns of Charles VII. and
Louis XI. contributed far more to her political than her literary renown.
A Greek professor was first appointed at Paris in 1458, before which time
the language had not been publicly taught, and was little
understood.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
Much less had Germany thrown off her ancient rudeness. √Üneas Sylvius,
indeed, a deliberate flatterer, extols every circumstance in the social
state of that country; but Campano, the papal legate at Ratisbon in 1471,
exclaims against the barbarism of a nation, where very few possessed any
learning, none any elegance.<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
Yet the progress of intellectual
cultivation, at least in the two former countries, was uniform, though
silent; libraries became more numerous, and books, after the happy
invention of paper, though still very scarce, might be copied at less
expense. Many colleges were founded in the English as well as foreign
universities during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Nor can I pass
over institutions that have so eminently contributed to the literary
reputation of this country, and that still continue to exercise so
conspicuous an influence over her taste and knowledge, as the two great
schools of grammatical learning, Winchester and Eton&mdash;the one founded by
William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, in 1373; the other in 1432, by
King Henry the Sixth.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Invention of printing.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
But while the learned of Italy were eagerly exploring their recent
acquisitions of manuscripts, decyphered with difficulty and slowly
circulated from hand to hand, a few obscure Germans had gradually
perfected the most important discovery recorded in the annals of mankind.
The invention of printing, so far from being the result of philosophical
sagacity, does not appear to have been suggested by any regard to the
higher branches of literature, or to bear any other relation than that of
coincidence to their revival in Italy. The question why it was struck out
at that particular time must be referred to that disposition of unknown
causes which we call accident. Two or three centuries earlier, we cannot
but acknowledge the discovery would have been almost equally acceptable.
But the invention of paper seems to have naturally preceded those of
engraving and printing. It is generally agreed that playing cards, which
have been traced far back in the fourteenth century, gave the first notion
of taking off impressions from engraved figures upon wood. The second
stage, or rather second application of this art, was the representation of
saints and other religious devices, several instances of which are still
extant. Some of these are accompanied with an entire page of illustrative
text, cut into the same wooden block. This process is indeed far removed
from the invention that has given immortality to the names of Fust,
Sch&oelig;ffer, and Gutenburg, yet it probably led to the consideration of
means whereby it might be rendered less operose and inconvenient. Whether
moveable wooden characters were ever employed in any entire work is very
questionable&mdash;the opinion that referred their use to Laurence Coster, of
Haarlem, not having stood the test of more accurate investigation. They
appear, however, in the capital letters of some early printed books. But
no expedient of this kind could have fulfilled the great purposes of this
invention, until it was perfected by founding metal types in a matrix or
mould, the essential characteristic of printing, as distinguished from
other arts that bear some analogy to it.</p>

<p>The first book that issued from the presses of Fust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span> and his associates at
Mentz was an edition of the Vulgate, commonly called the Mazarine Bible, a
copy having been discovered in the library that owes its name to Cardinal
Mazarin at Paris. This is supposed to have been printed between the years
1450 and 1455.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[h]</a>
In 1457 an edition of the Psalter appeared, and in
this the invention was announced to the world in a boasting colophon,
though certainly not unreasonably
bold.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[i]</a>
Another edition of the
Psalter, one of an ecclesiastical book, Durand's account of liturgical
offices, one of the Constitutions of Pope Clement V., and one of a popular
treatise on general science, called the Catholicon, filled up the interval
till 1462, when the second Mentz Bible proceeded from the same
printers.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[k]</a>
This, in the opinion of some, is the earliest book in which
cast types were employed&mdash;those of the Mazarine Bible having been cut with
the hand. But this is a controverted point. In 1465 Fust and Sch&oelig;ffer
published an edition of Cicero's Offices, the first tribute of the new art
to polite literature. Two pupils of their school, Sweynheim and Pannartz,
migrated the same year into Italy, and printed Donatus's grammar and the
works of Lactantius at the monastery of Subiaco, in the neighbourhood of
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[m]</a>
Venice had the honour of extending her patronage to John of
Spira, the first who applied the art on an extensive scale to the
publication of classical writers.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>
Several Latin authors came forth
from his press in 1470; and during the next ten years a multitude of
editions were published in various parts of Italy. Though, as we may judge
from their present scarcity, these editions were by no means numerous in
respect of impressions, yet, contrasted with the dilatory process of
copying manuscripts, they were like a new mechanical power in machinery,
and gave a wonderfully accelerated impulse to the intellectual cultivation
of mankind. From the era of these first editions proceeding from the
Spiras, Zarot, Janson, or Sweynheim and Pannartz, literature must be
deemed to have altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
revived in Italy. The sun was now fully above
the horizon, though countries less fortunately circumstanced did not
immediately catch his beams; and the restoration of ancient learning in
France and England cannot be considered as by any means effectual even at
the expiration of the fifteenth century. At this point, however, I close
the present chapter. The last twenty years of the middle ages, according
to the date which I have fixed for their termination in treating of
political history, might well invite me by their brilliancy to dwell upon
that golden morning of Italian literature. But, in the history of letters,
they rather appertain to the modern than the middle period; nor would it
become me to trespass upon the exhausted patience of my readers by
repeating what has been so often and so recently told, the story of art
and learning, that has employed the comprehensive research of a
Tiraboschi, a Ginguen√©, and a Roscoe.</p>

Guicciardini's estimate of the number of houses. If at least he was
accurate, more than half of the city must since have been demolished or
become uninhabited, which its present appearance does not indicate; for
Ghent, though not very flourishing, by no means presents the decay and

wool out of the kingdom, to the detriment of our staple manufacture, was
forbidden at common law (vol. iv. c. 19), not recollecting that we had no
staple manufactures in the ages when the common law was formed, and that
the export of wool was almost the only means by which this country
procured silver, or any other article of which it stood in need, from the
continent. In fact, the landholders were so far from neglecting this
source of their wealth, that a minimum was fixed upon it, by a statute of
1343 (repealed indeed the next year, 18 E. III. c. 3), below which price
it was not to be sold; from a laudable apprehension, as it seems, that
foreigners were getting it too cheap. And this was revived in the 32nd of
H. VI., though the act is not printed among the statutes. Rot. Parl. t. v.

is worthy of notice that English wool was superior to any other for
fineness during these ages. Henry II., in his patent to the Weavers'
Company, directs that, if any weaver mingled Spanish wool with English, it
should be burned by the lord mayor. Macpherson, p. 382. An English flock
transported into Spain about 1348 is said to have been the source of the
fine Spanish wool. Ibid. p. 539. But the superiority of English wool, even
as late as 1438, is proved by the laws of Barcelona forbidding its
adulteration. p. 654. Another exportation of English sheep to Spain took
place about 1465, in consequence of a commercial treaty. Rymer, t. xi. p.

which was reckoned the best in Europe; so that the exchange was tolerably
fair. Macpherson, p. 596. The best horses had been very dear in England,
being imported from Spain and Italy. Ibid.</p></div>

be English consul at Pisa, on the ground that some of his subjects
intended to trade to Italy. Macpherson, p. 705, from Rymer. Perhaps we
cannot positively prove the existence of a Mediterranean trade at an
earlier time; and even this instrument is not conclusive. But a
considerable presumption arises from two documents in Rymer, of the year
1412, which inform us of a great shipment of wool and other goods made by
some merchants of London for the Mediterranean, under supercargoes, whom,
it being a new undertaking, the king expressly recommended to the Genoese
republic. But that people, impelled probably by commercial jealousy,
seized the vessels and their cargoes; which induced the king to grant the
owners letters of reprisal against all Genoese property. Rymer, t. viii.
p. 717, 773. Though it is not perhaps evident that the vessels were
English, the circumstances render it highly probable. The bad success,
however, of this attempt, might prevent its imitation. A Greek author
about the beginning of the fifteenth century reckons the
<span class="grk">&Iota;&gamma;&gamma;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&omicron;&iota;</span>
among the nations who traded to a port in the Archipelago. Gibbon, vol.

love of exaggeration; and a few English sailors on board a foreign vessel
would justify the assertion. Benjamin of Tudela, a Jewish traveller,
pretends that the port of Alexandria, about 1160, contained vessels not
only from England, but from Russia, and even <i>Cracow</i>. Harris's Voyages,

[There must be, I suspect, some exaggeration about the commerce and
opulence of Amalfi, in the only age when she possessed any at all. The
city could never have been considerable, as we may judge from its position
immediately under a steep mountain; and what is still more material, has a
very small port. According to our notions of trade, she could never have
enjoyed much; the lines quoted from William of Apulia are to be taken as a
poet's panegyric. It is of course a question of degree; Amalfi was no
doubt a commercial republic to the extent of her capacity; but those who
have ever been on the coast must be aware how limited that was. At present
she has, I believe, no foreign trade at all. 1848.]</p></div>

months, going and returning; and he assures us it was perfectly secure,
not only for caravans, but for a single traveller with a couple of
interpreters and a servant. The Venetians had also a settlement in the
Crimea, and appear, by a passage in Petrarch's letters, to have possessed
some of the trade through Tartary. In a letter written from Venice, after
extolling in too rhetorical a manner the commerce of that republic, he
mentions a particular ship that had just sailed for the Black Sea. Et ipsa

We cannot be diverted, by the nonsensical theory these lines contain, from
perceiving the positive testimony of the last verse to the poet's
knowledge of the polarity of the magnet. But if any doubt could remain,
Tiraboschi (t. iv. p. 171) has fully established, from a series of
passages, that this phenomenon was well known in the thirteenth century;
and puts an end altogether to the pretensions of Flavio Gioja, if such a
person, ever existed. See also Macpherson's Annals, p. 364 and 418. It is
provoking to find an historian like Robertson asserting, without
hesitation, that this citizen of Amalfi was the inventor of the compass,
and thus accrediting an error which had already been detected.
</p><p>
It is a singular circumstance, and only to be explained by the obstinacy
with which men are apt to reject improvement, that the magnetic needle was
not generally adopted in navigation till very long after the discovery of
its properties, and even after their peculiar importance had been
perceived. The writers of the thirteenth century, who mention the polarity
of the needle, mention also its use in navigation; yet Capmany has found
no distinct proof of its employment till 1403, and does not believe that
it was frequently on board Mediterranean ships at the latter part of the
preceding age. Memorias Historicas, t. iii. p. 70. Perhaps however he has
inferred too much from his negative proof; and this subject seems open to
further inquiry.</p></div>

But, by whatever nation they were reduced into their present form, these
laws were certainly the ancient and established usages of the
Mediterranean states: and Pisa may very probably have taken a great share
in first practising what a century or two afterwards was rendered more
precise at Barcelona.</p></div>

second species was introduced by the Jews, about 1183 (Capmany, t. i. p.

reached nearly so soon. An instrument in Rymer, however, of the year 1364

negotiable bills; and by 1400 they were drawn in sets, and worded exactly

jurisprudence, has been employed to weaken principles that ought never to
have been acknowledged.
</p><p>
One species of usury, and that of the highest importance to commerce, was
always permitted, on account of the risk that attended it This was marine
insurance, which could not have existed, until money was considered, in
itself, as a source of profit. The earliest regulations on the subject of
insurance are those of Barcelona in 1433; but the practice was, of course,
earlier than these, though not of great antiquity. It is not mentioned in
the Consolato del Mare, nor in any of the Hanseatic laws of the fourteenth
century. Beckman, vol. i. p. 388. This author, not being aware of the
Barcelonese laws on this subject published by Capmany, supposes, the first
provisions regulating marine assurance to have been made at Florence in
1523.</p></div>

Heptarchy, and even before the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity;
but in this he gave the reins, as usual, to his imagination, which as much
exceeded his learning, as the latter did his judgment. Conisborough should
seem, by the name, to have been a royal residence, which it certainly
never was after the Conquest. But if the engravings of the decorative
parts in the Arch√¶ologia, vol. vi. p. 244, are not remarkably inaccurate,
the architecture is too elegant for the Danes, much more for the
unconverted Saxons. Both these castles are enclosed by a court or ballium,
with a fortified entrance, like those erected by the Normans.

his History of Inventions, vol. i., a work of very great research, cannot
trace any explicit mention of chimneys beyond the writings of John
Villani, wherein however they are not noticed as a new invention. Piers
Plowman, a few years later than Villani, speaks of a "chambre with a
chimney" in which rich men usually dined. But in the account-book of
Bolton Abbey, under the year 1311, there is a charge pro faciendo camino
in the rectory-house of Gargrave. Whitaker's Hist. of Craven, p. 331. This
may, I think, have been only an iron stove or fire-pan; though Dr. W.
without hesitation translates it a chimney. However, Mr. King, in his
observations on ancient castles, Arch√¶ol. vol. vi., and Mr. Strutt, in his
View of Manners, vol. i., describe chimneys in castles of a very old
construction. That at Conisborough in Yorkshire is peculiarly worthy of
attention, and carries back this important invention to a remote
antiquity.
</p><p>
In a recent work of some reputation, it is said:&mdash;"There does not appear
to be any evidence of the use of chimney-shafts in England prior to the
twelfth century. In Rochester Castle, which is in all probability the work
of William Corbyl, about 1130, there are complete fireplaces with
semicircular backs, and a shaft in each jamb, supporting a semicircular
arch over the opening, and that is enriched with the zigzag moulding; some
of these project slightly from the wall; the flues, however, go only a few
feet up in the thickness of the wall, and are then turned out at the back,
the apertures being small oblong holes. At the castle, Hedingham, Essex,
which is of about the same date, there are fireplaces and chimneys of a
similar kind. A few years later, the improvement of carrying the flue up
the whole height of the wall appears; as at Christ Church, Hants; the keep
at Newcastle; Sherborne Castle, &amp;c. The early chimney-shafts are of
considerable height, and similar; afterwards they assumed a great variety
of forms, and during the fourteenth century they are frequently very
short." Glossary of Ancient Architecture, p. 100, edit. 1845. It is said,
too, here that chimneys were seldom used in halls till near the end of the
fifteenth century; the smoke took its course, if it pleased, through a
hole in the roof.
</p><p>
Chimneys are still more modern in France; and seem, according to Paulmy,
to have come into common use since the middle of the seventeenth century.

several interesting facts of the same class, we have another inventory of

seems to have been a man of some consideration and probably a merchant.
The house consisted of a hall, parlour, buttery, and kitchen, with two
chambers, and one smaller, on the floor above; a napery, or linen room,
and three garrets, besides a shop, which was probably detached. There were
five bedsteads in the house, and on the whole a great deal of furniture
for those times; much more than I have seen in any other inventory. His

accommodations usual in the rank immediately below may be collected from
two inventories published by Strutt, one of Mr. Fermor's house at Easton,
the other Sir Adrian Foskewe's. I have mentioned the size of these
gentlemen's houses already. In the former, the parlour had wainscot, a
table and a few chairs; the chambers above had two best beds, and there
was one servant's bed; but the inferior servants had only mattresses on
the floor. The best chambers had window shutters and curtains. Mr. Fermor,
being a merchant, was probably better supplied than the neighbouring
gentry. His plate however consisted only of sixteen spoons, and a few
goblets and ale pots. Sir Adrian Foskewe's opulence appears to have been
greater; he had a service of silver plate, and his parlour was furnished
with hangings. This was in 1539; it is not to be imagined that a knight of
the shire a hundred years before would have rivalled even this scanty
provision of moveables. Strutt's View of Manners, vol. iii. p. 63. These
details, trifling as they may appear, are absolutely necessary in order to
give an idea with some precision of a state of national wealth so totally
different from the present.</p></div>

the parent of the Gothic. But the pointed arch does not occur, I believe,
in any Moorish buildings; while the great mosque of Cordova, built in the
eighth century, resembles, except by its superior beauty and magnificence,
one of our oldest cathedrals; the nave of Gloucester, for example, or
Durham. Even the vaulting is similar, and seems to indicate some
imitation, though perhaps of a common model. Compare Arch√¶ologia, vol.
xvii. plate 1 and 2, with Murphy's Arabian Antiquities, plate 5. The
pillars indeed at Cordova are of the Corinthian order, perfectly executed,
if we may trust the engraving, and the work, I presume, of Christian
architects; while those of our Anglo-Norman cathedrals are generally an
imitation of the Tuscan shaft, the builders not venturing to trust their
roofs to a more slender support, though Corinthian foliage is common in
the capitals, especially those of smaller ornamental columns. In fact, the
Roman architecture is universally acknowledged to have produced what we
call the Saxon or Norman; but it is remarkable that it should have been
adopted, with no variation but that of the singular horse-shoe arch, by
the Moors of Spain.
</p><p>
The Gothic, or pointed arch, though very uncommon in the genuine Saracenic
of Spain and the Levant, may be found in some prints from Eastern
buildings; and is particularly striking in the fa√ßade of the great mosque
at Lucknow, in Salt's designs for Lord Valentia's Travels. The pointed
arch buildings in the Holy Land have all been traced to the age of the
Crusades. Some arches, if they deserve the name, that have been referred
to this class, are not pointed by their construction, but rendered such by
cutting off and hollowing the projections of horizontal stones.</p></div>

that "the image of Theodoric's palace at Verona, still extant on a coin,
represents the oldest and most authentic model of Gothic architecture."
vol. vii. p. 33. For this he refers to Maffei, Verona Illustrata, p. 31,
where we find an engraving, not indeed of a coin, but of a seal; the
building represented on which is in a totally dissimilar style. The
following passages in Cassiodorus, for which I am indebted to M. Ginguen√©,
Hist. Litt√©r. de l'Italie, t. i. p. 55, would be more to the purpose: Quid
dicamus columnarum junceam proceritatem? moles illas sublimissimas
fabricarum quasi quibusdam erectis hastilibus contineri. These columns of
reedy slenderness, so well described by juncea proceritas, are said to be
found in the cathedral of Montreal in Sicily, built in the eighth century.
Knight's Principles of Taste, p. 162. They are not however sufficient to
justify the denomination of Gothic, which is usually confined to the
pointed arch style.</p></div>

Denis about 1140. The cathedral of Laon is said to have been dedicated in
1114. Hist. Litt√©raire de la France, t. ix. p. 220. I do not know in what
style the latter of these churches is built, but the former is, or rather
was, Gothic. Notre Dame at Paris was begun soon after the middle of the
twelfth century, and completed under St. Louis. M√©langes tir√©s d'une
grande biblioth√®que, t. xxxi. p. 108. In England, the earliest specimen I
have seen of pointed arches is in a print of St. Botolphe's Priory at
Colchester, said by Strutt to have been built in 1110. View of Manners,
vol. i. plate 30. These are apertures formed by excavating the space
contained by the intersection of semicircular, or Saxon arches; which are
perpetually disposed, by way of ornament, on the outer as well as inner
surface of old churches, so as to cut each other, and consequently to
produce the figure of a Gothic arch; and if there is no mistake in the
date, they are probably among the most ancient of that style in Europe.
Those of the church of St. Cross near Winchester are of the reign of
Stephen; and generally speaking, the pointed style, especially in
vaulting, the most important object in the construction of a building, is
not considered as older than Henry II. The nave of Canterbury cathedral,
of the erection of which by a French architect about 1176 we have a full
account in Gervase (Twysden, Decem Scriptores, col. 1289), and the Temple
church, dedicated in 1183, are the most ancient English buildings
altogether in the Gothic manner.
</p><p>
The subject of ecclesiastical architecture in the middle ages has been so
fully discussed by intelligent and observant writers since these pages
were first published, that they require some correction. The oriental
theory for the origin of the pointed architecture, though not given up,
has not generally stood its ground; there seems more reason to believe
that it was first adopted in Germany, as Mr. Hope has shown; but at first
in single arches, not in the construction of the entire building.
</p><p>
The circular and pointed forms, instead of one having at once supplanted
the other, were concurrent in the same building, through Germany, Italy,
and Switzerland, for some centuries. I will just add to the instances
mentioned by Mr. Hope and others, and which every traveller may
corroborate, one not very well known, perhaps as early as any,&mdash;the crypt
of the cathedral at Basle, built under the reign of the emperor Henry II.,
near the commencement of the eleventh century, where two pointed with
three circular arches stand together, evidently from want of space enough
to preserve the same breadth with the necessary height. The same
circumstance will be found, I think, in the crypt of St. Denis, near
Paris, which, however, is not so old. The writings of Hope, Rickman,
Whewell, and Willis are prominent among many that have thrown light on
this subject. The beauty and magnificence of the pointed style is
acknowledged on all sides; perhaps the imitation of it has been too
servile, and with too much forgetfulness of some very important changes in
our religious aspect rendering that simply ornamental which was once
directed to a great object. [1848.]</p></div>

treated only by panegyrists or calumniators, both equally mendacious. I do
not wish to pry into the mysteries of the craft; but it would be
interesting to know more of their history during the period when they were
literally architects. They are charged by an act of parliament, 3 H. VI.
c. i., with fixing the price of their labour in their annual chapters,
contrary to the statute of labourers, and such chapters are consequently
prohibited. This is their first persecution; they have since undergone
others, and are perhaps reserved for still more. It is remarkable, that
masons were never legally incorporated, like other traders; their bond of

eloquent passage from Dr. Whitaker. "Could a curious observer of the
present day carry himself nine or ten centuries back, and ranging the
summit of Pendle survey the forked vale of Calder on one side, and the
bolder margins of Ribble and Hadder on the other, instead of populous
towns and villages, the castle, the old tower-built house, the elegant
modern mansion, the artificial plantation, the inclosed park and pleasure
ground: instead of uninterrupted inclosures which have driven sterility
almost to the summit of the fells, how great must then have been the
contrast, when ranging either at a distance, or immediately beneath, his
eye must have caught vast tracts of forest ground stagnating with bog or
darkened by native woods, where the wild ox, the roe, the stag, and the
wolf, had scarcely learned the supremacy of man, when, directing his view
to the intermediate spaces, to the windings of the valleys, or the expanse
of plains beneath, he could only have distinguished a few insulated
patches of culture, each encircling a village of wretched cabins, among
which would still be remarked one rude mansion of wood, scarcely equal in
comfort to a modern cottage, yet then rising proudly eminent above the
rest, where the Saxon lord, surrounded by his faithful cotarii, enjoyed a
rude and solitary independence, owning no superior but his sovereign."
Hist. of Whalley, p. 133. About a fourteenth part of this parish of
Whalley was cultivated at the time of Domesday. This proportion, however,
would by no means hold in the counties south of Trent.</p></div>

Turner, "that Domesday Survey gives us some indication that the
cultivation of the church lands was much superior to that of any other
order of society. They have much less wood upon them, and less common of
pasture; and what they had appears often in smaller and more irregular
pieces; while their meadow was more abundant, and in more numerous
distributions." Hist. of Anglo-Saxons, vol. ii. p. 167.

It was the glory of St. Benedict's reform, to have substituted bodily
labour for the supine indolence of oriental asceticism. In the East it was
more difficult to succeed in such an endeavour, though it had been made.
"The Benedictins have been," says Guizot, "the great clearers of land in
Europe. A colony, a little swarm of monks, settled in places nearly
uncultivated, often in the midst of a pagan population, in Germany, for
example, or in Britany; there, at once missionaries and labourers, they
accomplished their double service through peril and fatigue." Civilis. en
France, Le√ßon 14. The north-eastern parts of France, as far as the Lower
Seine, were reduced into cultivation by the disciples of St. Columban, in
the sixth and seventh centuries. The proofs of this are in Mabillon's Acta
Sanctorum Ord. Bened. See M√©m. de l'Acad. des Sciences Morales et
Politiques, iii. 708.
</p><p>
Guizot has appreciated the rule of St. Benedict with that candid and
favourable spirit which he always has brought to the history of the
church: anxious, as it seems, not only to escape the imputation of
Protestant prejudices by others, but to combat them in his own mind; and
aware, also, that the partial misrepresentations of Voltaire had sunk into
the minds of many who were listening to his lectures. Compared with the
writers of the eighteenth century, who were too much alienated by the
faults of the clergy to acknowledge any redeeming virtues, or even with
Sismondi, who, coming in a moment of reaction, feared the returning
influence of medi√¶val prejudices, Guizot stands forward as an equitable

Croisades, p. 226. An inundation in their own country is supposed to have
immediately produced this emigration; but it was probably successive, and
connected with political as well as physical causes of greater permanence.
The first instrument in which they are mentioned is a grant from the
bishop of Hamburgh in 1106. This colony has affected the local usages, as
well as the denominations of things and places along the northern coast of
Germany. It must be presumed that a large proportion of the emigrants were
diverted from agriculture to people the commercial cities which grew up in
the twelfth century upon that coast.</p></div>

improvement, is perhaps the best that has appeared, would, I think, have
acted better, by omitting all references to mere historians, and relying
entirely on regular documents. I do not however include local histories,
such as the Annals of Dunstaple, when they record the market-prices of
their neighbourhood, in respect of which the book last mentioned is almost
in the nature of a register. Dr. Whitaker remarks the inexactness of
Stowe, who says that wheat sold in London, <small>A.D.</small> 1514, at 20<i>s.</i> a quarter:
whereas it appears to have been at 9<i>s.</i> in Lancashire, where it was
always dearer than in the metropolis. Hist. of Whalley, p. 97. It is an
odd mistake, into which Sir F. Eden has fallen, when he asserts and argues
on the supposition, that the price of wheat fluctuated in the thirteenth
century, from 1<i>s.</i> to 6<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> a quarter, vol. i. p. 18. Certainly, if
any chronicler had mentioned such a price as the latter, equivalent to
150<i>l.</i> at present, we should either suppose that his text was corrupt, or
reject it as an absurd exaggeration. But, in fact, the author has, through
haste, mistaken 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for 6<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i>, as will appear by referring
to his own table of prices, where it is set down rightly. It is observed
by Mr. Macpherson, a very competent judge, that the arithmetical
statements of the best historians of the middle ages are seldom correct,
owing partly to their neglect of examination, and partly to blunders of
transcribers. Annals of Commerce, vol. i, p. 423.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_716_716" id="Footnote_716_716"></a><a href="#FNanchor_716_716"><span class="label">[p]</span></a> The table of comparative values by Sir George Shuckburgh
(Philosoph. Transact. for 1798, p. 196) is strangely incompatible with
every result to which my own reading has led me. It is the hasty attempt
of a man accustomed to different studies; and one can neither pardon the
presumption of obtruding such a slovenly performance on a subject where
the utmost diligence was required, nor the affectation with which he
apologizes for "descending from the dignity of philosophy."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_717_717" id="Footnote_717_717"></a><a href="#FNanchor_717_717"><span class="label">[q]</span></a> M. Gu√©rard, editor of "Paris sous Philippe le Bel," in the
Documens In√©dits (1841, p. 365), after a comparison of the prices of corn,
concludes that the value of silver has declined since that reign, in the
ratio of five to one. This is much less than we allow in England. M. Leber
(M√©m. de l'Acad. des Inscript. Nouvelle S√©rie, xiv. 230) calculates the
power of silver under Charlemagne, compared with the present day, to have
been as nearly eleven to one. It fell afterwards to eight, and continued
to sink during the middle ages; the average of prices during the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, taking corn as the standard, was six
to one; the comparison is of course only for France. This is an
interesting paper, and contains tables worthy of being consulted.</p></div>

Hawsted, furnish several pieces even at this early period. Most of them
are collected by Sir F. Eden. Fleta reckons 4<i>s.</i> the average price of a
quarter of wheat in his time. 1. ii. c. 84. This writer has a digression
on agriculture, whence however less is to be collected than we should
expect.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_719_719" id="Footnote_719_719"></a><a href="#FNanchor_719_719"><span class="label">[s]</span></a> The fluctuations of price have unfortunately been so great
of late years, that it is almost as difficult to determine one side of our
equation as the other. Any reader, however, has it in his power to correct
my proportions, and adopt a greater or less multiple, according to his own
estimate of current prices, or the changes that may take place from the
time when this is written [1816].</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_720_720" id="Footnote_720_720"></a><a href="#FNanchor_720_720"><span class="label">[t]</span></a> I have sometimes been surprised at the facility with which
prices adjusted themselves to the quantity of silver contained in the
current coin, in ages which appear too ignorant and too little commercial
for the application of this mercantile principle. But the extensive
dealings of the Jewish and Lombard usurers, who had many debtors in almost
all parts of the country, would of itself introduce a knowledge, that
silver, not its stamp, was the measure, of value. I have mentioned in
another place (vol. i. p. 211) the heavy discontents excited by this
debasement of the coin in France; but the more gradual enhancement of
nominal prices in England seems to have prevented any strong
manifestations of a similar spirit at the successive reductions in value
which the coin experienced from the year 1300. The connexion however
between commodities and silver was well understood. Wykes, an annalist of
Edward I.'s age, tells us, that the Jews clipped our coin, till it
retained hardly half its due weight, the effect of which was a general
enhancement of prices, and decline of foreign trade: Mercatores
transmarini cum mercimoniis suis regnum Angli√¶ minus solito frequentabant;
necnon quod omnimoda venalium genera incomparabiliter solito fuerunt
cariora. 2 Gale, XV Script. p. 107. Another chronicler of the same age
complains of bad foreign money, alloyed with copper; nec erat in quatuor
aut quinque ex iis pondus unius denarii argentii.... Eratque pessimum
s√¶culum pro tali monet√¢, et fiebant commutationes plurim√¶ in emptione et
venditione rerum. Edward, as the historian informs us, bought in this bad
money at a rate below its value, in order to make a profit; and fined some
persons who interfered with his traffic. W. Hemingford, ad ann. 1299.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_721_721" id="Footnote_721_721"></a><a href="#FNanchor_721_721"><span class="label">[u]</span></a> These will chiefly be found in Sir F. Eden's table of
prices; the following may be added from the account-book of a convent
between 1415 and 1425. Wheat varied from 4<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i>&mdash;barley from 3<i>s.</i>
2<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>&mdash;oats from 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;oxen from
12<i>s.</i> to 16<i>s.</i>&mdash;sheep from 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;butter 3/4<i>d.</i>
per lb.&mdash;eggs twenty-five for 1<i>d.</i>&mdash;cheese 1/2<i>d.</i> per lb. Lansdowne
MSS., vol. i. No. 28 and 29. These prices do not always agree with those
given in other documents of equal authority in the same period; but the
value of provisions varied in different counties, and still more so in
different seasons of the year.</p></div>

that of the shilling before the last coinage, which reduced it.

distinction between the reigns of Edw. III. and Henry VIII. (perhaps a
misprint for VI.), with regard to the state of the labouring classes. The
two periods appear to have been essentially different in this respect."
Principles of Political Economy, p. 293, 1st edit. He conceives that the
earnings of the labourer in corn were unusually low in the latter years of
Edward III., which appears to have been effected by the statute of
labourers (25 E. III.), immediately after the great pestilence of 1350,
though that mortality ought, in the natural course of things, to have
considerably raised the real wages of labour. The result of his researches
is that, in the reign of Edward III., the labourer could not purchase half
a peck of wheat with a day's labour; from that of Richard II. to the
middle of that of Henry VI., he could purchase nearly a peck; and from
thence to the end of the century, nearly two pecks. At the time when the
passage in the text was written [1816], the labourer could rarely have
purchased more than a peck with a day's labour, and frequently a good deal
less. In some parts of England this is the case at present [1846]; but in
many counties the real wages of agricultural labourers are considerably
higher than at that time, though not by any means so high as, according to
Malthus himself, they were in the latter half of the fifteenth century.
The excessive fluctuations in the price of corn, even taking averages of a
long term of years, which we find through the middle ages, and indeed much
later, account more than any other assignable cause for those in real
wages of labour, which do not regulate themselves very promptly by that
standard, especially when coercive measures are adopted to restrain them.</p></div>

little treatise of Petrus Siculus, who lived about 870, under Basil the
Macedonian. He had been employed on an embassy to Tephrica, the principal
town of these heretics, so that he might easily be well informed; and,
though he is sufficiently bigoted, I do not see any reason to question the
general truth of his testimony, especially as it tallies so well with what
we learn of the predecessors and successors of the Paulicians. They had
rejected several of the Manichean doctrines, those, I believe, which were
borrowed from the Oriental, Gnostic, and Cabbalistic philosophy of
emanation; and therefore readily condemned Manes,

&alpha;&nu;&alpha;&theta;&epsilon;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&#8055;&zeta;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;
&Mu;&#8049;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;</span>.
But they retained his capital errors, so far as
regarded the principle of dualism, which he had taken from Zerdusht's
religion, and the consequences he had derived from it. Petrus Siculus
enumerates six Paulician heresies. 1. They maintained the existence of two
deities, the one evil, and the creator of this world; the other good, called
<span class="grk">&pi;&alpha;&tau;&#8052;&rho;
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&#8049;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
the author of that which is to come. 2.
They refused to worship the Virgin, and asserted that Christ brought his
body from heaven. 3. They rejected the Lord's Supper. 4. And the adoration
of the cross. 5. They denied the authority of the Old Testament, but
admitted the New, except the epistles of St. Peter, and, perhaps, the
Apocalypse. 6. They did not acknowledge the order of priests.
</p><p>
There seems every reason to suppose that the Paulicians, notwithstanding
their mistakes, were endowed with sincere and zealous piety, and studious
of the Scriptures. A Paulician woman asked a young man if he had read the
Gospels: he replied that laymen were not permitted to do so, but only the
clergy:

were already forbidden in the Greek church, which I am inclined to
believe, notwithstanding the leniency with which Protestant writers have
treated it, was always more corrupt and more intolerant than the Latin.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_743_743" id="Footnote_743_743"></a><a href="#FNanchor_743_743"><span class="label">[u]</span></a> It is generally agreed, that the Manicheans from Bulgaria
did not penetrate into the west of Europe before the year 1000; and they
seem to have been in small numbers till about 1140. We find them, however,
early in the eleventh century. Under the reign of Robert in 1007 several
heretics were burned at Orleans for tenets which are represented as
Manichean. Velly, t. ii. p. 307. These are said to have been imported from
Italy; and the heresy began to strike root in that country about the same
time. Muratori, Dissert. 60 (Antichit√† Italiane, t. iii. p. 304). The
Italian Manicheans were generally called Paterini, the meaning of which
word has never been explained. We find few traces of them in France at
this time; but about the beginning of the twelfth century, Guibert, bishop
of Soissons, describes the heretics of that city, who denied the reality
of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and rejected the
sacraments. Hist. Litt√©raire de la France, t. x. p. 451. Before the middle
of that age, the Cathari, Henricians, Petrobussians, and others appear,
and the new opinions attracted universal notice. Some of these sectaries,
however, were not Manicheans. Mosheim, vol. iii. p. 116.
</p><p>
The acts of the inquisition of Toulouse, published by Limborch, from an
ancient manuscript, contain many additional proofs that the Albigenses
held the Manichean doctrine. Limborch himself will guide the reader to the
principal passages, p. 30. In fact, the proof of Manicheism among the
heretics of the twelfth century is so strong (for I have confined myself
to those of Languedoc, and could easily have brought other testimony as to
the Cathari), that I should never have thought of arguing the point, but
for the confidence of some modern ecclesiastical writers.&mdash;What can we
think of one who says, "It was not unusual to stigmatize new sects with
the odious name of Manichees, though I <i>know no evidence</i> that there were
any real remains of that ancient sect in the twelfth century"? Milner's
History of the Church, vol. iii. p. 380. Though this writer was by no
means learned enough for the task he undertook, he could not be ignorant
of facts related by Mosheim and other common historians.
</p><p>
I will only add, in order to obviate cavilling, that I use the word
Albigenses for the Manichean sects, without pretending to assert that
their doctrines prevailed more in the neighbourhood of Albi than
elsewhere. The main position is, that a large part of the Languedocian
heretics against whom the crusade was directed had imbibed the Paulician
opinions. If any one chooses rather to call them Catharists, it will not
be material.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_745_745" id="Footnote_745_745"></a><a href="#FNanchor_745_745"><span class="label">[y]</span></a> There has been so prevalent a disposition among English
divines to vindicate not only the morals and sincerity, but the orthodoxy
of these Albigenses, that I deem it necessary to confirm what I have said
in the text by some authorities, especially as few readers have it in
their power to examine this very obscure subject. Petrus Monachus, a
Cistercian monk, who wrote a history of the crusades against the
Albigenses, gives an account of the tenets maintained by the different
heretical sects. Many of them asserted two principles or creative beings:
a good one for things invisible, an evil one for things visible; the
former author of the New Testament, the latter of the Old. Novum
Testamentum benigno deo, vetus vero maligno attribuebant; et illud omnin√≤
repudiabant, pr√¶ter quasdam auctoritates, qu√¶ de Veteri Testamento Novo
sunt insert√¶, quas ob Novi reverentiam Testamenti recipere dignum
√¶stimabant. A vast number of strange errors are imputed to them, most of
which are not mentioned by Alanus, a more dispassionate writer. Du Chesne,
Scriptores Francorum, t. v. p. 556. This Alanus de Insulis, whose treatise
against heretics, written about 1200, was published by Masson at Lyons, in
1612, has left, I think, conclusive evidence of the Manicheism of the
Albigenses. He states their argument upon every disputed point as fairly
as possible, though his refutation is of course more at length. It appears
that great discrepancies of opinion existed among these heretics, but the
general tenor of their doctrines is evidently Manichean. Aiunt h√¶retici
temporis nostri quod duo sunt principia rerum, principium lucis et
principium tenebrarum, &amp;c. This opinion, strange as we may think it, was
supported by Scriptural texts; so insufficient is a mere acquaintance with
the sacred writings to secure unlearned and prejudiced minds from the
wildest perversions of their meaning! Some denied the reality of Christ's
body; others his being the Son of God; many the resurrection of the body;
some even of a future state. They asserted in general the Mosaic law to
have proceeded from the devil, proving this by the crimes committed during
its dispensation, and by the words of St. Paul, "the law entered that sin
might abound." They rejected infant baptism, but were divided as to the
reason; some saying that infants could not sin, and did not need baptism;
others, that they could not be saved without faith, and consequently that
it was useless. They held sin after baptism to be irremissible. It does
not appear that they rejected either of the sacraments. They laid great
stress upon the imposition of hands, which seems to have been their
distinctive rite.
</p><p>
One circumstance, which both Alanus and Robertus Monachus mention, and
which other authorities confirm, is their division into two classes; the
Perfect, and the Credentes, or Consolati, both of which appellations are
used. The former abstained from animal food, and from marriage, and led in
every respect an austere life. The latter were a kind of lay brethren,
living in a secular manner. This distinction is thoroughly Manichean, and
leaves no doubt as to the origin of the Albigenses. See Beausobre, Hist.
du Manich√©isme, t. ii. p. 762 and 777. This candid writer represents the
early Manicheans as a harmless and austere set of enthusiasts, exactly
what the Paulicians and Albigenses appear to have been in succeeding ages.
As many calumnies were vented against one as the other.
</p><p>
The long battle as to the Manicheism of the Albigensian sectaries has been
renewed since the publication of this work, by Dr. Maitland on one side,
and Mr. Faber and Dr. Gilly on the other; and it is not likely to reach a
termination; being conducted by one party with far less regard to the
weight of evidence than to the bearing it may have on the theological
hypotheses of the writers. I have seen no reason for altering what is said
in the text.
</p><p>
The chief strength of the argument seems to me to lie in the independent
testimonies as to the Manicheism of the Paulicians, in Petrus Siculus and
Photius, on the one hand, and as to that of the Languedocian heretics in
the Latin writers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries on the other;
the connexion of the two sects through Bulgaria being established by
history, but the latter class of writers being unacquainted with the
former. It is certain that the probability of general truth in these
concurrent testimonies is greatly enhanced by their independence. And it
will be found that those who deny any tinge of Manicheism in the
Albigenses, are equally confident as to the orthodoxy of the Paulicians.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_746_746" id="Footnote_746_746"></a><a href="#FNanchor_746_746"><span class="label">[z]</span></a> The contemporary writers seem uniformly to represent Waldo
as the founder of the Waldenses; and I am not aware that they refer the
locality of that sect to the valleys of Piedmont, between Exiles and
Pignerol (see Leger's map), which have so long been distinguished as the
native country of the Vaudois. In the acts of the Inquisition, we find
Waldenses, sive pauperes de Lugduno, used as equivalent terms; and it can
hardly be doubted that the poor men of Lyons were the disciples of Waldo.
Alanus, the second book of whose treatise against heretics is an attack
upon the Waldenses, expressly derives them from Waldo. Petrus Monachus
does the same. These seem strong authorities, as it is not easy to
perceive what advantage they could derive from misrepresentation. It has
been however a position zealously maintained by some modern writers of
respectable name, that the people of the valleys had preserved a pure
faith for several ages before the appearance of Waldo. I have read what is
advanced on this head by Leger (Histoire des Eglises Vaudoises) and by
Allix (Remarks on the Ecclesiastical History of the Churches of Piedmont),
but without finding any sufficient proof for this supposition, which
nevertheless is not to be rejected as absolutely improbable. Their best
argument is deduced from an ancient poem called La Noble Loi√ßon, an
original manuscript of which is in the public library of Cambridge, and
another in that of Geneva. This poem is alleged to bear date in 1100, more
than half a century before the appearance of Waldo. But the lines that
contain the date are loosely expressed, and may very well suit with any
epoch before the termination of the twelfth century.

I have found however a passage in a late work, which remarkably
illustrates the antiquity of Alpine protestantism, if we may depend on the
date it assigns to the quotation. Mr. Planta's History of Switzerland, p.
93, 4to. edit., contains the following note:&mdash;"A curious passage,
singularly descriptive of the character of the Swiss, has lately been
discovered in a MS. chronicle of the Abbey of Corvey, which appears to
have been written about the beginning of the twelfth century. Religionem
nostram, et omnium Latin√¶ ecclesi√¶ Christianorum fidem, laici ex Suavi√¢,
Suici√¢, et Bavari√¢ humiliare voluerunt; homines seducti ab antiqu√¢
progenie simplicium hominum, qui Alpes et viciniam habitant, et semper
amant antiqua. In Suaviam, Bavariam et Italiam borealem s√¶pe intrant
illorum (ex Suici√¢) mercatores, qui biblia ediscunt memoriter, et ritus
ecclesi√¶ aversantur, quos credunt esse novos. Nolunt imagines venerari,
reliquias sanctorum aversantur, olera comedunt, rar√≤ masticantes carnem,
alii nunquam. Appellamus eos idcirc√≤ Manich√¶os. Horum quidam ab Hungari√¢
ad eos convenerunt, &amp;c." It is a pity that the quotation has been broken
off, as it might have illustrated the connexion of the Bulgarians with
these sectaries.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_747_747" id="Footnote_747_747"></a><a href="#FNanchor_747_747"><span class="label">[a]</span></a> The Waldenses were always considered as much less erroneous
in their tenets than the Albigenses, or Manicheans. Erant pr√¶terea alii
h√¶retici, says Robert Monachus in the passage above quoted, qui Waldenses
dicebantur, a quodam Waldio nomine Lugdunensi. Hi quidem mali erant, sed
comparatione aliorum h√¶reticorum long√® minus perversi; in multis enim
nobiscum conveniebant, in quibusdam dissentiebant. The only faults he
seems to impute to them are the denial of the lawfulness of oaths and
capital punishment, and the wearing wooden shoes. By this peculiarity of
wooden sandals (sabots) they got the name of Sabbatati or Insabbatati. (Du
Cange.) William du Puy, another historian of the same time, makes a
similar distinction. Erant quidam Ariani, quidam Manich√¶i, quidam etiam
Waldenses sive Lugdunenses, qui licet inter se dissidentes, omnes tamen in
animarum perniciem contra fidem Catholicam conspirabant; et illi quidem
Waldenses contra alios acutissim√® disputant. Du Chesne, t. v. p. 666.
Alanus, in his second book, where he treats of the Waldenses, charges them
principally with disregarding the authority of the church and preaching
without a regular mission. It is evident however from the acts of the
Inquisition, that they denied the existence of purgatory; and I should
suppose that, even at that time, they had thrown off most of the popish
system of doctrine, which is so nearly connected with clerical wealth and
power. The difference made in these records between the Waldenses and the
Manichean sects shows that the imputations cast upon the latter were not
indiscriminate calumnies. See Limborch, p. 201 and 228.
</p><p>
The History of Languedoc, by Vaissette and Vich, contains a very good
account of the sectaries in that country; but I have not immediate access
to the book. I believe that proof will be found of the distinction between
the Waldenses and Albigenses in t. iii. p. 446. But I am satisfied that no
one who has looked at the original authorities will dispute the
proposition. These Benedictine historians represent the Henricians, an
early set of reformers, condemned by the council of Lombez, in 1165, as
Manichees. Mosheim considers them as of the Vaudois school. They appeared
some time before Waldo.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_748_748" id="Footnote_748_748"></a><a href="#FNanchor_748_748"><span class="label">[b]</span></a> The general testimony of their enemies to the purity of
morals among the Languedocian and Lyonese sectaries is abundantly
sufficient. One Regnier, who had lived among them, and became afterwards
an inquisitor, does them justice in this respect. See Turner's History of
England for several other proofs of this. It must be confessed that the
Catharists are not free from the imputation of promiscuous licentiousness.
But whether this was a mere calumny, or partly founded upon truth, I
cannot determine. Their prototypes, the ancient Gnostics, are said to have
been divided into two parties, the austere and the relaxed; both
condemning marriage for opposite reasons. Alanus, in the book above
quoted, seems to have taken up several vulgar prejudices against the
Cathari. He gives an etymology of their name √† catto; quia osculantur
posteriora catti; in cujus specie, ut aiunt, appareret iis Lucifer, p.
146. This notable charge was brought afterwards against the Templars.
</p><p>
As to the Waldenses, their innocence is out of all doubt. No book can be
written in a more edifying manner than La Noble Loi√ßon, of which large
extracts are given by Leger, in his Histoire des Eglises Vaudoises. Four
lines are quoted by Voltaire (Hist. Universelle, c. 69), as a specimen of
the Proven√ßal language, though they belong rather to the patois of the
valleys. But as he has not copied them rightly, and as they illustrate the
subject of this note, I shall repeat them here from Leger, p. 28.

authorities which attest the existence of the sects derived from the
Waldenses and Paulicians in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth
centuries. Besides Mosheim, who has paid considerable attention to the
subject, I would mention some articles in Du Cange which supply gleanings;
namely, Beghardi, Bulgari, Lollardi, Paterini, Picardi, Pifli, Populicani.
</p><p>
Upon the subject of the Waldenses and Albigenses generally, I have
borrowed some light from Mr. Turner's History of England, vol. ii. p. 377,
393. This learned writer has seen some books that have not fallen into my
way; and I am indebted to him for a knowledge of Alanus's treatise, which
I have since read. At the same time I must observe, that Mr. Turner has
not perceived the essential distinction between the two leading sects.
</p><p>
The name of Albigenses does not frequently occur after the middle of the
thirteenth century; but the Waldenses, or sects bearing that denomination,
were dispersed over Europe. As a term of different reproach was derived
from the word Bulgarian, so <i>vauderie</i>, or the profession of the Vaudois,
was sometimes applied to witchcraft. Thus in the proceedings of the
Chambre Brulante at Arras, in 1459, against persons accused of sorcery,
their crime is denominated <i>vauderie</i>. The fullest account of this
remarkable story is found in the Memoirs of Du Clercq, first published in
the general collection of Historical Memoirs, t. ix. p. 430, 471. It
exhibits a complete parallel to the events that happened in 1682 at Salem
in New England. A few obscure persons were accused of <i>vauderie</i>, or
witchcraft. After their condemnation, which was founded on confessions
obtained by torture, and afterwards retracted, an epidemical contagion of
superstitious dread was diffused all around. Numbers were arrested, burned
alive by order of a tribunal instituted for the detection of this offence,
or detained in prison; so that no person in Arras thought himself safe. It
was believed that many were accused for the sake of their possessions,
which were confiscated to the use of the church. At length the duke of
Burgundy interfered, and put a stop to the persecutions. The whole
narrative in Du Clercq is interesting, as a curious document of the
tyranny of bigots, and of the facility with which it is turned to private
ends.
</p><p>
To return to the Waldenses: the principal course of their emigration is
said to have been into Bohemia, where, in the fifteenth century, the name
was borne by one of the seceding sects. By their profession of faith,
presented to Ladislaus Posthumus, it appears that they acknowledged the
corporal presence in the eucharist, but rejected purgatory and other
Romish doctrines. See it in the Fasciculus Rerum expetendarum et
fugiendarum, a collection of treatises illustrating the origin of the
Reformation, originally published at Cologne in 1535, and reprinted at

remark. It has been said that our church maintained the privilege of
having part of the daily service in the mother tongue. "Even the mass
itself," says Lappenberg, "was not read entirely in Latin." Hist. of
England, vol. i. p. 202. This, however, is denied by Lingard, whose
authority is probably superior. Hist. of Ang.-Sax. Church, i. 307. But he
allows that the Epistle and Gospel were read in English, which implies an
authorized translation. And we may adopt in a great measure Lappenberg's
proposition, which follows the above passage: "The numerous versions and
paraphrases of the Old and New Testament made those books known to the
laity and more familiar to the clergy."
</p><p>
We have seen a little above, that the laity were not permitted by the
Greek Church of the ninth century, and probably before, to read the
Scriptures, even in the original. This shows how much more honest and
pious the Western Church was before she became corrupted by ambition and
by the captivating hope of keeping the laity in servitude by means of
ignorance. The translation of the four Books of Kings into French has been
published in the Collection de Documens In√©dits, 1841. It is in a northern
dialect, but the age seems not satisfactorily ascertained; the close of
the eleventh century is the earliest date that can be assigned.
Translations into the Proven√ßal by the Waldensian or other heretics were
made in the twelfth; several manuscripts of them are in existence, and one
has been published by Dr. Gilly. [1848.]</p></div>

Pecock's answer to the Lollards of his time contains passages well worthy

This great man fell afterwards under the displeasure of the church for
propositions, not indeed heretical, but repugnant to her scheme of
spiritual power. He asserted, indirectly, the right of private judgment,
and wrote on theological subjects in English, which gave much offence. In
fact, Pecock seems to have hoped that his acute reasoning would convince
the people, without requiring an implicit faith. But he greatly
misunderstood the principle of an infallible church. Lewis's Life of
Pecock does justice to his character, which, I need not say, is unfairly
represented by such historians as Collier, and such antiquaries as Thomas

drawn by Mr. Sharon Turner, in his valuable History of England, between
Achilles and Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion; the superior justness of which I
readily acknowledge. The real hero does not indeed excite so much interest
in me as the poetical; but the marks of resemblance are very striking,
whether we consider their passions, their talents, their virtues, their
vices, or the waste of their heroism.
</p><p>
The two principal persons in the Iliad, if I may digress into the
observation, appear to me representatives of the heroic character in its
two leading varieties; of the energy which has its sole principle, of
action within itself, and of that which borrows its impulse from external
relations; of the spirit of honour, in short, and of patriotism. As every
sentiment of Achilles is independent and self-supported, so those of
Hector all bear reference to his kindred and his country. The ardour of
the one might have been extinguished for want of nourishment in Thessaly;
but that of the other might, we fancy, have never been kindled but for the
dangers of Troy. Peace could have brought no delight to the one but from
the memory of war; war had no alleviation to the other but from the images
of peace. Compare, for example, the two speeches, beginning Il. Z. 441,
and Il. II. 49; or rather compare the two characters throughout the Iliad.
So wonderfully were those two great springs of human sympathy, variously
interesting according to the diversity of our tempers, first touched by

Otho of Frisingen expresses the same in prose. It is said, in the
Establishments of St. Louis, that if any one not being a gentleman on the
father's side was knighted, the king or baron in whose territory he
resides, may hack off his spurs on a dunghill, c. 130. The count de
Nevers, having knighted a person who was not noble exparte patern√¢, was
fined in the king's court. The king, however, (Philip III.) confirmed the
knighthood. Daniel, Hist. de la Milice Fran√ßoise, p. 98. Fuit propositum
(says a passage quoted by Daniel) contra comitem Flandriensem, quod non
poterat, nec debebat facere de villano militem, sine auctoritate regis.
ibid. Statuimus, says James I. of Aragon, in 1234, ut nullus faciat
militem nisi filium militis. Marca Hispanica, p. 1428. Selden, Titles of
Honour, p. 592, produces other evidence to the same effect. And the
emperor Sigismund having conferred knighthood, during his stay in Paris in
1415, on a person incompetent to receive it for want of nobility, the
French were indignant at his conduct, as an assumption of sovereignty.
Villaret, t. xiii. p. 397. We are told, however, by Giannone, 1. xx. c. 3,
that nobility was not in fact required for receiving chivalry at Naples,
though it was in France.
</p><p>
The privilege of every knight to associate qualified persons to the order
at his pleasure, lasted very long in France; certainly down to the English
wars of Charles VII. (Monstrelet, part ii. folio 50), and, if I am not
mistaken, down to the time of Francis I. But in England, where the spirit
of independence did not prevail so much among the nobility, it soon
ceased. Selden mentions one remarkable instance in a writ of the 29th year
of Henry III. summoning tenants in capite to come and receive knighthood
from the king, ad recipiendum a nobis arma militaria; and tenants of mesne
lords to be knighted by whomsoever they pleased, ad recipiendum arma de
quibuscunque voluerint. Titles of Honour, p. 792. But soon after this
time, it became an established principle of our law that no subject can
confer knighthood except by the king's authority. Thus Edward III. grants
to a burgess of <i>Lyndia</i> in Guienne (I know not what place this is) the
privilege of receiving that rank at the hands of any knight, his want of
noble birth notwithstanding. Rymer, t. v. p. 623. It seems, however, that
a different law obtained in some places. Twenty-three of the chief
inhabitants of Beaucaire, partly knights, partly burgesses, certified in
1298, that the immemorial usage of Beaucaire and of Provence had been, for
burgesses to receive knighthood at the hands of noblemen, without the
prince's permission. Vaissette, Hist. de Languedoc, t. iii. p. 530.
Burgesses, in the great commercial towns, were considered as of a superior
class to the roturiers, and possessed a kind of demi-nobility. Charles V.
appears to have conceded a similar indulgence to the citizens of Paris.
Villaret, t. x. p. 248.</p></div>

chevalier; in opposition to banneret. But this cannot be right. We do not
find any authority for the expression bas chevalier, nor any equivalent in
Latin, baccalaureus certainly not suggesting that sense; and it is strange
that the corruption should obliterate every trace of the original term.
Bachelor is a very old word, and is used in early French poetry for a
young man, as bachelette is for a girl. So also in Chaucer:
</p>

men at arms, whom a banneret ought to command, was properly fifty. But
Olivier de la Marche speaks of twenty-five as sufficient; and it appears
that, in fact, knights-banneret often did not bring so many.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_790_790" id="Footnote_790_790"></a><a href="#FNanchor_790_790"><span class="label">[z]</span></a> Ibid. Olivier de la Marche (Collection des M√©moires, t.
viii. p. 337) gives a particular example of this; and makes a distinction
between the bachelor, created a banneret on account of his estate, and the
hereditary banneret, who took a public opportunity of requesting the
sovereign to unfold his family banner which he had before borne wound
round his lance. The first was said relever banniere; the second, entrer
en banniere. This difference is more fully explained by Daniel, Hist. de
la Milice Fran√ßoise, p. 116. Chandos's banner was unfolded, not cut, at
Navarette. We read sometimes of esquire-bannerets, that is, of bannerets
by descent, not yet knighted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_793_793" id="Footnote_793_793"></a><a href="#FNanchor_793_793"><span class="label">[c]</span></a> The prerogative exercised by the kings of England of
compelling men sufficiently qualified in point of estate to take on them
the honour of knighthood was inconsistent with the true spirit of
chivalry. This began, according to Lord Lyttelton, under Henry III. Hist.
of Henry II. vol. ii. p. 238. Independently of this, several causes tended
to render England less under the influence of chivalrous principles than
France or Germany; such as, her comparatively peaceful state, the smaller
share she took in the crusades, her inferiority in romances of
knight-errantry, but above all, the democratical character of her laws and
government. Still this is only to be understood relatively to the two
other countries above named; for chivalry was always in high repute among
us, nor did any nation produce more admirable specimens of its
excellences.
</p><p>
I am not minutely acquainted with the state of chivalry in Spain, where it
seems to have flourished considerably. Italy, except in Naples, and
perhaps Piedmont, displayed little of its spirit; which neither suited the
free republics of the twelfth and thirteenth, nor the jealous tyrannies of
the following centuries. Yet even here we find enough to furnish Muratori
with materials for his 53rd Dissertation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_794_794" id="Footnote_794_794"></a><a href="#FNanchor_794_794"><span class="label">[d]</span></a> The well-known Memoirs of St. Palaye are the best
repository of interesting and illustrative facts respecting chivalry.
Possibly he may have relied a little too much on romances, whose pictures
will naturally be overcharged. Froissart himself has somewhat of this
partial tendency, and the manners of chivalrous times do not make so fair
an appearance in Monstrelet. In the Memoirs of la Tremouille (Collect. des
M√©m. t. xiv. p. 169), we have perhaps the earliest delineation from the
life of those severe and stately virtues in high-born ladies, of which our
own country furnished so many examples in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and which were derived from the influence of chivalrous
principles. And those of Bayard in the same collection (t. xiv. and xv.)
are a beautiful exhibition of the best effects of that discipline.
</p><p>
It appears to me that M. Guizot, to whose judgment I owe all deference,
has dwelt rather too much on the feudal character of chivalry. Hist. de la
Civilisation en France, Le√ßon 36. Hence he treats the institution as in
its decline during the fourteenth century, when, if we can trust either
Froissart or the romancers, it was at its height. Certainly, if mere
knighthood was of right both in England and the north of France, a
territorial dignity, which bore with it no actual presumption of merit, it
was sometimes also conferred on a more honourable principle. It was not
every knight who possessed a fief, nor in practice did every possessor of
a fief receive knighthood.
</p><p>
Guizot justly remarks, as Sismondi has done, the disparity between the
lives of most knights and the theory of chivalrous rectitude. But the same
has been seen in religion, and can be no reproach to either principle.
Partout la pens√©e morale des hommes s'√©l√®ve et aspire fort au dessus de
leur vie. Et gardez vous de croire que parce qu'elle ne gouvernait pas
imm√©diatement les actions, parceque la pratique d√©montait sans cesse et
√©trangement la th√©orie, l'influence de la th√©orie fut nulle et sans
valeur. C'est beaucoup que le jugement des hommes sur les actions
humaines; tot ou tard il devient efficace.
</p><p>
It may be thought by many severe judges, that I have over-valued the
efficacy of chivalrous sentiments in elevating the moral character of the
middle ages. But I do not see ground for withdrawing or modifying any
sentence. The comparison is never to be made with an ideal standard, or
even with one which a purer religion and a more liberal organization of
society may have rendered effectual, but with the condition of a country
where neither the sentiments of honour nor those of right prevail. And it
seems to me that I have not veiled the deficiencies and the vices of
chivalry any more than its beneficial tendencies.
</p><p>
A very fascinating picture of chivalrous manners has been drawn by a
writer of considerable reading, and still more considerable ability, Mr.
Kenelm Digby, in his Broad Stone of Honour. The bravery, the
courteousness, the munificence, above all, the deeply religious character
of knighthood and its reverence for the church, naturally took hold of a
heart so susceptible of these emotions, and a fancy so quick to embody
them. St. Palaye himself is a less enthusiastic eulogist of chivalry,
because he has seen it more on the side of mere romance, and been less
penetrated with the conviction of its moral excellence. But the progress
of still deeper impression seems to have moderated the ardour of Mr.
Digby's admiration for the historical character of knighthood; he has
discovered enough of human alloy to render unqualified praise hardly
fitting, in his judgment, for a Christian writer; and in the Mores
Catholici, the second work of this amiable and gifted man, the colours in
which chivalry appears are by no means so brilliant [1848.]</p></div>

those of M. Ginguen√© and M. Sismondi, the history of England by Mr. Sharon
Turner, and the Literary History of the Middle Ages by Mr. Berington. All
of these contain more or less useful information and judicious remarks;
but that of Ginguen√© is among the most learned and important works of this

that he has not extenuated the effect of Bracton's predilection for the
maxims of Roman jurisprudence. No early lawyer has contributed so much to
form our own system as Bracton; and if his definitions and rules are
sometimes borrowed from the civilians, as all admit, our common law may
have indirectly received greater modification from that influence, than
its professors were ready to acknowledge, or even than they knew. A full
view of this subject is still, I think, a desideratum in the history of
English law, which it would illustrate in a very interesting manner.</p></div>

is evident that Tiraboschi knew very little of law, and had not read the
civilians of whom he treats; whereas Gravina discusses their merits not

[The civil lawyers of the medi√¶val period are not at all forgotten on the
continent, as the great work of Savigny, History of Roman Law in the
Middle Ages, sufficiently proves. It is certain that the civil law must
always be studied in Europe, nor ought the new codes to supersede it,
seeing they are in great measure derived from its fountain; though I have
heard that it is less regarded in France than formerly. In my earlier
editions I depreciated the study of the civil law too much, and with too
exclusive an attention to English notions.]</p></div>

period might seem to throw some suspicion on this passage. But it is
impossible to detach it from the context; and the works of Aristotle
intended by Ingulfus were translations of parts of his Logic by Boethius
and Victorin. Brucker, p. 678. A passage indeed in Peter of Blois's
continuation of Ingulfus, where the study of Averroes is said to have
taken place at <i>Cambridge</i> some years before he was born, is of a
different complexion, and must of course be rejected as spurious. In the

doubt upon the whole. I have, in the Introduction to the History of
Literature, retracted the degree of credence here given to the foundation
of the university of Oxford by Alfred. If Ingulfus is not genuine, we have
no proof of its existence as a school of learning before the middle of the

to Cambridge, some to Reading, in order to carry on their studies (p. 191,

were led to a town so distant as Cambridge by the previous establishment
of academical instruction in that place. The incorporation of Cambridge is
in 1231 (15 Hen. III.), so that there is no great difference in the legal

(Hist. de la Philosophie Moderne, t. i. p. 696), appears to agree with
Brucker. It is almost certain that versions were made from the Arabic
Aristotle: which itself was not immediately taken from the Greek, but from
a Syriac medium. Ginguen√©, Hist. Litt. de l'Italie, t. i. p. 212 (on the
authority of M. Langl√©s).
</p><p>
It was not only a knowledge of Aristotle that the scholastics of Europe
derived from the Arabic language. His writings had produced in the
flourishing Mohammedan kingdoms a vast number of commentators, and of
metaphysicians trained in the same school. Of these Averroes, a native of
Cordova, who died early in the thirteenth century, was the most eminent.
It would be curious to examine more minutely than has hitherto been done
the original writings of these famous men, which no doubt have suffered in
translation. A passage from Al Gazel, which Mr. Turner has rendered from
the Latin, with all the disadvantage of a double remove from the author's
words, appears to state the argument in favour of that class of
Nominalists, called Conceptualists, with more clearness and precision than
any thing I have seen from the schoolmen. Al Gazel died in 1126, and
consequently might have suggested this theory to Abelard, which however is
not probable. Turner's Hist. of Engl. vol. i. p. 513.</p></div>

better guide than Brucker. But he confesses himself not to have read the
original writings of the scholastics; an admission which every reader will
perceive to be quite necessary. Consequently, he gives us rather a verbose
declamation against their philosophy than any clear view of its character.
Of the valuable works lately published in Germany on the history of
philosophy, I have only seen that of Buhle, which did not fall into my
hands till I had nearly written these pages. Tiedemann and Tennemann are I
believe, still untranslated.</p></div>

author raises upon the whole a favourable notion of Anselm and Aquinas;
but he hardly notices any other.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_843_843" id="Footnote_843_843"></a><a href="#FNanchor_843_843"><span class="label">[i]</span></a> Mr. Turner has with his characteristic spirit of enterprise
examined some of the writings of our chief English schoolmen, Duns Scotus
and Ockham (Hist of Eng. vol. i.), and even given us some extracts from
them. They seem to me very frivolous, so far as I can collect their
meaning. Ockham in particular falls very short of what I had expected; and
his nominalism is strangely different from that of Berkeley. We can hardly
reckon a man in the right, who is so by accident, and through sophistical
reasoning. However, a well-known article in the Edinburgh Review, No.
liii. p. 204, gives, from Tennemann, a more favourable account of Ockham.
</p><p>
Perhaps I may have imagined the scholastics to be more forgotten than they
really are. Within a short time I have met with four living English
writers who have read parts of Thomas Aquinas; Mr. Turner, Mr. Berington,
Mr. Coleridge, and the Edinburgh Reviewer. Still I cannot bring myself to
think that there are four more in this country who can say the same.
Certain portions, however, of his writings are still read in the course of
instruction of some Catholic universities.

[I leave this passage as it was written about 1814. But it must be owned
with regard to the schoolmen, as well as the jurists, that I at that time
underrated, or at least did not anticipate, the attention which their
works have attracted in modern Europe, and that the passage in the text is
more applicable to the philosophy of the eighteenth century than of the
present. For several years past the metaphysicians of Germany and France
have brushed the dust from the scholastic volumes; Tennemann and Buhle,
Degerando, but more than all Cousin and R√©musat, in their excellent
labours on Abelard, have restored the medi√¶val philosophy to a place in
transcendental metaphysics, which, during the prevalence of the Cartesian
school, and those derived from it, had been refused. 1848.]</p></div>

ages, complains of the ignorance of Aristotle's translators. Every
translator, he observes, ought to understand his author's subject, and the
two languages from which and into which he is to render the work. But none
hitherto, except Boethius, have sufficiently known the languages; nor has
one, except Robert Grostete (the famous bishop of Lincoln), had a
competent acquaintance with science. The rest make egregious errors in
both respects. And there is so much misapprehension and obscurity in the
Aristotelian writings as thus translated, that no one understands them.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_848_848" id="Footnote_848_848"></a><a href="#FNanchor_848_848"><span class="label">[p]</span></a> This mystical philosophy appears to have been introduced
into Europe by John Scotus, whom Buhle treats as the founder of the
scholastic philosophy; though, as it made no sensible progress for two
centuries after his time, it seems more natural to give that credit to
Roscelin and Anselm. Scotus, or Erigena, as he is perhaps more frequently
called, took up, through the medium of a spurious work, ascribed to
Dionysius the Areopagite, that remarkable system, which has from time
immemorial prevailed in some schools of the East, wherein all external
phenomena, as well as all subordinate intellects, are considered as
<i>emanating</i> from the Supreme Being, into whose essence they are hereafter
to be absorbed. This system, reproduced under various modifications, and
combined with various theories of philosophy and religion, is perhaps the
most congenial to the spirit of solitary speculation, and consequently the
most extensively diffused of any which those high themes have engendered.
It originated no doubt in sublime conceptions of divine omnipotence and
ubiquity. But clearness of expression, or indeed of ideas, being not
easily connected with mysticism, the language of philosophers adopting the
theory of emanation is often hardly distinguishable from that of the
pantheists. Brucker, very unjustly, as I imagine from the passages he
quotes, accuses John Erigena of pantheism. Hist. Crit. Philos. p. 620. The
charge would, however, be better grounded against some whose style might
deceive an unaccustomed reader. In fact, the philosophy of emanation leads
very nearly to the doctrine of an universal substance, which, begot the
atheistic system of Spinoza, and which appears to have revived with
similar consequences among the metaphysicians of Germany. How very closely
the language of this oriental philosophy, or even that which regards the
Deity as the soul of the world, may verge upon pantheism, will be
perceived (without the trouble of reading the first book of Cudworth) from
two famous passages of Virgil and Lucan. Georg. I. iv. v. 219; and
Pharsalia, I. viii. v. 578.</p></div>

The resemblance between Roger Bacon and his greater namesake is very
remarkable. Whether Lord Bacon ever read the Opus Majus, I know not; but
it is singular, that his favourite quaint expression, <i>pr√¶rogativ√¶</i>
scientiarum, should be found in that work, though not used with the same
allusion to the Roman comitia. And whoever reads the sixth part of the
Opus Majus, upon experimental science, must be struck by it as the
prototype, in spirit, of the Novum Organum. The same sanguine and
sometimes rash confidence in the effect of physical discoveries, the same
fondness for experiment, the same preference of inductive to abstract
reasoning, pervade both works. Roger Bacon's philosophical spirit may be
illustrated by the following passage: Duo sunt modi cognoscendi; scilicet
per argumentum et experimentum. Argumentum concludit et facit nos
concludere qu√¶stionem; sed non certificat neque removet dubitationem, ut
quiescat animus in intuitu veritatis, nisi eam inveniat vi√¢ experienti√¶;
quia multi habent argumenta ad scibilia, sed quia non habent experientiam,
negligunt ea, neque vitant nociva nec persequuntur bona. Si enim aliquis
homo, qui nunquam vidit ignem, probavit per argumenta sufficientia quod
ignis comburit et l√¶dit res et destruit, nunquam propter hoc quiesceret
animus audientis, nec ignem vitaret antequam poneret manum vel rem
combustibilem ad ignem, ut per experientiam probaret quod argumentum
edocebat; sed assumt√¢ experienti√¢ combustionis certificatur animus et
quiescit in fulgore veritatis, quo argumentum non sufficit, sed
experientia. p. 446.</p></div>

Allowing for the metaphysical obscurity in which Dante chooses to envelop

I have read in some modern book, but know not where to seek the passage,
that Petrarch did not intend to allude to Dante in the letter to Boccaccio
mentioned above, but rather to Zanobi Strata, a contemporary Florentine
poet, whom, however forgotten at present, the bad taste of a party in
criticism preferred to himself.&mdash;Matteo Villani mentions them together as
the two great ornaments of his age. This conjecture seems probable, for
some expressions are not in the least applicable to Dante. But whichever
was intended, the letter equally shows the irritable humour of Petrarch.</p></div>

arms. No expense had been spared in copying all his works as they
appeared. He was received by Capra with a princely magnificence; lodged in
a chamber hung with purple, and a splendid bed on which no one before or

instance, were opulent persons; yet the friends of Petrarch dissuaded him

sparsi. In a famous passage of his Confessions, he says: Corpus illud
egregium morbis et crebris partubus exhaustum, multum pristini vigoris
amisit. Those who maintain the virginity of Laura are forced to read
<i>perturbationibus</i>, instead of <i>partubus</i>. Two manuscripts in the royal
library at Paris have the contraction <i>ptbus</i>, which leaves the matter
open to controversy. De Sade contends that "crebris" is less applicable to
"perturbationibus" than to "partubus." I do not know that there is much in
this; but I am clear that corpus exhaustum partubus is much the more
elegant Latin expression of the two.</p></div>

published by Mr. Ellis, in his Specimens of Early English Poetry, vol. i.
p. 61. This extract contains, he observes, no word which we are under the
necessity of ascribing to a French origin.
</p><p>
[Layamon, as is now supposed, wrote in the reign of John. See Sir
Frederick Madden's edition, and Mr. Wright's Biographia Literaria. The
best reason seems to be that he speaks of Eleanor, queen of Henry, as then
dead, which took place in 1204. But it requires a vast knowledge of the
language to find a date by the use or disuse of particular forms; the
idiom of one part of England not being similar to that of another in
grammatical flexions. See Quarterly Review for April 1848.
</p><p>
The entire work of Layamon contains a small number of words taken from the
French; about fifty in the original text, and about forty more in that of
a manuscript, perhaps half a century later, and very considerably altered
in consequence of the progress of our language. Many of these words
derived from the French express new ideas, as admiral, astronomy, baron,
mantel, &amp;c. "The language of Layamon," says Sir Frederick Madden, "belongs
to that transition period in which the groundwork of Anglo-Saxon
phraseology and grammar still existed, although gradually yielding to the
influence of the popular forms of speech. We find in it, as in the later
portion of the Saxon Chronicle, marked indications of a tendency to adopt
those terminations and sounds which characterize a language in a state of
change, and which are apparent also in some other branches of the Teutonic
tongue. The use of <i>a</i> as an article&mdash;the change of the Anglo-Saxon
terminations <i>a</i> and <i>an</i> into <i>e</i> and <i>en</i>, as well as the disregard of
inflections and genders&mdash;the masculine forms given to neuter nouns in the
plural&mdash;the neglect of the feminine terminations of adjectives and
pronouns, and confusion between the definite and indefinite
declensions&mdash;the introduction of the preposition <i>to</i> before infinitives,
and occasional use of weak preterites of verbs and participles instead of
strong&mdash;the constant recurrence of <i>er</i> for <i>or</i> in the plurals of
verbs&mdash;together with the uncertainty of the rule for the government of
prepositions&mdash;all these variations, more or less visible in the two texts
of Layamon, combined with the vowel-changes, which are numerous, though
not altogether arbitrary, will show at once the progress made in two
centuries, in departing from the ancient and purer grammatical forms, as
found in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts." Preface, p. xxviii.]</p></div>

The tragedy of Eccerinus (Eccelin da Romano), by Albertinus Mussatus, a
Paduan, and author of a respectable history, deserves some attention, as
the first attempt to revive the regular tragedy. It was written soon after
1300. The language by no means wants animation, notwithstanding an
unskilful conduct of the fable. The Eccerinus is printed in the tenth
volume of Muratori's collection.</p></div>

century. Peter of Blois mentions a law book which he had procured a quodam
publico mangone librorum. Hist. Litt√©raire de la France, t. ix. p. 84. In
the thirteenth century there were many copyists by occupation in the
Italian universities. Tiraboschi, t. iv. p. 72. The number of these at
Milan before the end of that age is said to have been fifty. Ibid. But a
very small proportion of their labour could have been devoted to purposes
merely literary. By a variety of ordinances, the first of which bears date
in 1275, the booksellers of Paris were subjected to the control of the
university. Crevier, t. ii. p. 67, 286. The pretext of this was, lest
erroneous copies should obtain circulation. And this appears to have been
the original of those restraints upon the freedom of publication, which
since the invention of printing have so much retarded the diffusion of
truth by means of that great instrument.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_899_899" id="Footnote_899_899"></a><a href="#FNanchor_899_899"><span class="label">[y]</span></a> Tiraboschi, t. v. p. 85. On the contrary side are
Montfaucon, Mabillon, and Muratori; the latter of whom carries up the
invention of our ordinary paper to the year 1000. But Tiraboschi contends
that the paper used in manuscripts of so early an age was made from cotton
rags, and, apparently from the inferior durability of that material, not
frequently employed. The editors of Nouveau Trait√© de Diplomatique are of
the same opinion, and doubt the use of linen paper before the year 1300.
t. i. p. 517, 521. Meerman, well known as a writer upon the antiquities of
printing, offered a reward for the earliest manuscript upon linen paper,
and, in a treatise upon the subject, fixed the date of its invention
between 1270 and 1300. But M. Schwandner of Vienna is said to have found
in the imperial library a small charter bearing the date of 1243 on such
paper. Macpherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. i. p. 394. Tiraboschi, if he
had known this, would probably have maintained the paper to be made of
cotton, which he says it is difficult to distinguish. He assigns the
invention of linen paper to Pace da Fabiano of Treviso. But more than one
Arabian writer asserts the manufacture of linen paper to have been carried
on at Samarcand early in the eighth century, having been brought thither
from China. And what is more conclusive, Casiri positively declares many
manuscripts in the Escurial of the eleventh and twelfth centuries to be
written on that substance. Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispanica, t. ii. p. 9.
This authority appears much to outweigh the opinion of Tiraboschi in
favour of Pace da Fabiano, who must perhaps take his place at the table of
fabulous heroes with Bartholomew Schwartz and Flavio Gioja. But the
material point, that paper was very little known in Europe till the latter
part of the fourteenth century, remains as before. See Introduction to
History of Literature, c. i. ¬ß 58.</p></div>

transcribed in this abbey under one abbot, about the year 1300. Every
considerable monastery had a room, called Scriptorium, where this work was
performed. More than eighty were transcribed at St. Albans under
Whethamstede, in the time of Henry VI. ibid. See also Du Cange, V
Scriptores. Nevertheless we must remember, first, that the far greater
part of these books were mere monastic trash, or at least useless in our
modern apprehension; secondly, that it depended upon the character of the
abbot, whether the scriptorium should be occupied or not. Every head of a
monastery was not a Whethamstede. Ignorance and jollity, such as we find
in Bolton Abbey, were their more usual characteristics. By the account
books of this rich monastery, about the beginning of the fourteenth
century, three books only appear to have been purchased in forty years.

It is said that a Greek psalter was written in an abbey at Tournay about
1105. Hist. Litt. de la France, t. ix. p. 102. This was, I should think, a
very rare instance of a Greek manuscript, sacred or profane, copied in the
western parts of Europe before the fifteenth century. But a Greek psalter
written in Latin characters at Milan in the 9th century was sold some
years ago in London. John of Salisbury is said by Crevier to have known a
little Greek, and he several times uses technical words in that language.
Yet he could not have been much more learned than his neighbours; since,
having found the word
<span class="grk">&omicron;&#8016;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;</span>
in St. Ambrose, he was forced to ask
the meaning of one John Sarasin, an Englishman, because, says he, none of
our masters here (at Paris) understand Greek. Paris, indeed, Crevier
thinks, could not furnish any Greek scholar in that age except Abelard and
Heloise, and probably neither of them knew much. Hist. de l'Univers. de
Paris, t. i. p. 259.
</p><p>
The ecclesiastical language, it may be observed, was full of Greek words
Latinized. But this process had taken place before the fifth century; and
most of them will be found in the Latin dictionaries. A Greek word was now
and then borrowed, as more imposing than the correspondent Latin. Thus the
English and other kings sometimes called themselves Basileus, instead of
Rex.
</p><p>
It will not be supposed that I have professed to enumerate all the persons
of whose acquaintance with the Greek tongue some evidence may be found;
nor have I ever directed my attention to the subject with that view.
Doubtless the list might be more than doubled. But, if ten times the
number could be found, we should still be entitled to say, that the
language was almost unknown, and that it could have had no influence on
the condition of literature. [See Introduction to Hist. of Literature,

in this. Nevertheless, there is one manifest difference between the Greek
writers of the worst period, such as the eighth century, and those who
correspond to them in the West. Syncellus, for example, is of great use in
chronology, because he was acquainted with many ancient histories now no
more. But Bede possessed nothing which we have lost; and his compilations
are consequently altogether unprofitable. The eighth century, the S√¶culum
Iconoclasticum of Cave, low as it was in all polite literature, produced
one man, John Damascenus, who has been deemed the founder of scholastic
theology, and who at least set the example of that style of reasoning in
the East. This person, and Michael Psellus, a philosopher of the eleventh
century, are the only considerable men, as original writers, in the annals
of Byzantine literature.</p></div>

pure Latin. In fact, the Greek language seems to have declined much in the
same manner as the Latin did, and almost at as early a period. In the
sixth century, Damascius, a Platonic philosopher, mentions the old
language as distinct from that which was vernacular,

Du Cange, ibid. p. 11. It is well
known that the popular, or <i>political</i> verses of Tzetzes, a writer of the
twelfth century, are accentual; that is, are to be read, as the modern
Greeks do, by treating every acute or circumflex syllable as long, without
regard to its original quantity. This innovation, which must have produced
still greater confusion of metrical rules than it did in Latin, is much
older than the age of Tzetzes; if, at least, the editor of some notes
subjoined to Meursius's edition of the Themata of Constantine
Porphyrogenitus (Lugduni, 1617) is right in ascribing certain political
verses to that emperor, who died in 959. These verses are regular
accentual trochaics. But I believe they have since been given to
Constantine Manasses, a writer of the eleventh century.

According to the opinion of a modern traveller (Hobhouse's Travels in
Albania, letter 33) the chief corruptions which distinguish the Romaic
from its parent stock, especially the auxiliary verbs, are not older than
the capture of Constantinople by Mahomet II. But it seems difficult to
obtain any satisfactory proof of this; and the auxiliary verb is so
natural and convenient, that the ancient Greeks may probably, in some of
their local idioms, have fallen into the use of it; as Mr. H. admits they
did with respect to the future auxiliary

<h2>NOTES TO CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><a name="N1_1"></a>Note</span> I. Page 288.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A rapid</span> decline of learning began in the sixth century, of which Gregory
of Tours is both a witness and an example. It is, therefore, properly one
of the dark ages, more so by much than the eleventh, which concludes them;
since very few were left in the church who possessed any acquaintance with
classical authors, or who wrote with any command of the Latin language.
Their studies, whenever they studied at all, were almost exclusively
theological; and this must be understood as to the subsequent centuries.
By theological is meant the vulgate Scriptures and some of the Latin
fathers; not, however, by reasoning upon them, or doing much more than
introducing them as authority in their own words. In the seventh century,
and still more at the beginning of the eighth, very little even of this
remained in France, where we find hardly a name deserving of remembrance
in a literary sense; but Isidore, and our own Bede, do honour to Spain and
Britain.</p>

<p>It may certainly be said for France and Germany, notwithstanding a partial
interruption in the latter part of the ninth and beginning of the tenth
century, that they were gradually progressive from the time of
Charlemagne. But then this progress was so very slow, and the men in front
of it so little capable of bearing comparison with those of later times,
considering their writings positively and without indulgence, that it is
by no means unjust to call the centuries dark which elapsed between
Charlemagne and the manifest revival of literary pursuits towards the end
of the eleventh century. Alcuin, for example, has left us a good deal of
poetry. This is superior to what we find in some other writers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
obscure period, and indicates both a correct ear and a familiarity with
the Latin poets, especially Ovid. Still his verses are not as good as
those which schoolboys of fourteen now produce, either in poetical power
or in accuracy of language and metre. The errors indeed are innumerable.
Aldhelm, an earlier Anglo-Saxon poet, with more imaginative spirit, is
further removed from classical poetry. Lupus, abbot of Ferri√®res, early in
the ninth century, in some of his epistles writes tolerable Latin, though
this is far from being always the case; he is smitten with a love of
classical literature, quotes several poets and prose writers, and is
almost as curious about little points of philology as an Italian scholar
of the fifteenth century. He was continually borrowing books in order to
transcribe them&mdash;a proof, however, of their scarcity and of the low
condition of general learning, which is the chief point we have to
regard.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
But his more celebrated correspondent, Eginhard, went beyond
him. Both his Annals and the Life of Charlemagne are very well written, in
a classical spirit, unlike the church Latin; though a few words and
phrases may not be of the best age, I should place Eginhard above Alcuin
and Lupus, or, as far as I know, any other of the Caroline period.</p>

<p>The tenth century has in all times borne the worst name. Baronius calls
it, in one page, <i>plumbeum</i>, <i>obscurum</i>, <i>infelix</i> (Annales, <small>A.D.</small> 900).
And Cave, who dubs all his centuries by some epithet, assigns <i>ferreum</i> to
the tenth. Nevertheless, there was considerably less ignorance in France
and Germany during the latter part of this age than before the reign of
Charlemagne, or even in it; more glimmerings of acquaintance with the
Latin classics appear; and the schools, cathedral and conventual, had
acquired a more regular and uninterrupted scheme of instruction. The
degraded condition of papal Rome has led many to treat this century rather
worse than it deserves; and indeed Italy was sunk very low in ignorance.
As to the eleventh century, the upward progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
was extremely
perceptible. It is commonly reckoned among the dark ages till near its
close; but these phrases are of course used comparatively, and because the
difference between that and the twelfth was more sensible than we find in
any two that are consecutive since the sixth.</p>

<p>The state of literature in England was by no means parallel to what we
find on the continent. Our best age was precisely the worst in France; it
was the age of the Heptarchy&mdash;that of Theodore, Bede, Aldhelm, C√¶dmon, and
Alcuin; to whom, if Ireland will permit us, we may desire to add Scotus,
who came a little afterwards, but whose residence in this island at any
time appears an unauthenticated tale. But we know how Alfred speaks of the
ignorance of the clergy in his own age. Nor was this much better
afterwards. Even the eleventh century, especially before the Conquest, is
a very blank period in the literary annals of England. No one can have a
conception how wretchedly scanty is the list of literary names from Alfred
to the Conquest, who does not look to Mr. Turner's History of the
Anglo-Saxons, or to Mr. Wright's Biographia Literaria.</p>

<p>There could be no general truth respecting the past, as it appeared to me,
more notorious, or more incapable of being denied with any plausibility,
than the characteristic ignorance of Europe during those centuries which
we commonly style the Dark Ages. A powerful stream, however, of what, as
to the majority at least, I must call prejudice, has been directed of late
years in an opposite direction. The medi√¶val period, in manners, in arts,
in literature, and especially in religion, has been regarded with unwonted
partiality; and this favourable temper has been extended to those ages
which had lain most frequently under the ban of historical and literary
censure.</p>

<p>A considerable impression has been made on the predisposed by the Letters
on the Dark Ages, which we owe to Dr. Maitland. Nor is this by any means
surprising; both because the predisposed are soon convinced, and because
the Letters are written with great ability, accurate learning, a spirited
and lively pen, and consequently with a success in skirmishing warfare
which many readily mistake for the gain of a pitched battle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span> Dr. Maitland
is endowed with another quality, far more rare in historical controversy,
especially of the ecclesiastical kind: I believe him to be of scrupulous
integrity, minutely exact in all that he asserts; and indeed the wrath and
asperity, which sometimes appear rather more than enough, are only called
out by what he conceives to be wilful or slovenly misrepresentation. Had
I, therefore, the leisure and means of following Dr. Maitland through his
quotations, I should probably abstain from doing so from the reliance I
should place on his testimony, both in regard to his power of discerning
truth and his desire to express it. But I have no call for any
examination, could I institute it; since the result of my own reflections
is that every thing which Dr. M. asserts as matter of fact&mdash;I do not say
suggests in all his language&mdash;may be perfectly true, without affecting the
great proposition that the dark ages, those from the sixth to the
eleventh, were ages of ignorance. Nor does he, as far as I collect,
attempt to deny this evident truth; it is merely his object to prove that
they were less ignorant, less dark, and in all points of view less worthy
of condemnation than many suppose. I do not gainsay this position; being
aware, as I have observed both in this and in another work, that the mere
ignorance of these ages, striking as it is in comparison with earlier and
later times, has been sometimes exaggerated; and that Europeans, and
especially Christians, could not fall back into the absolute barbarism of
the Esquimaux. But what a man of profound and accurate learning puts
forward with limitations, sometimes expressed, and always present to his
own mind, a heady and shallow retailer takes up, and exaggerates in
conformity with his own prejudices.</p>

<p>The Letters on the Dark Ages relate principally to the theological
attainments of the clergy during that period, which the author assumes,
rather singularly, to extend from <small>A.D.</small> 800 to 1200; thus excluding
midnight from his definition of darkness, and replacing it by the break of
day. And in many respects, especially as to the knowledge of the vulgate
Scriptures possessed by the better-informed clergy, he obtains no very
difficult victory over those who have imbibed extravagant notions, both as
to the ignorance of the Sacred Writings in those times and the desire to
keep them away from the people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
This latter prejudice is obviously
derived from a confusion of the subsequent period, the centuries preceding
the Reformation, with those which we have immediately before us. But as
the word <i>dark</i> is commonly used, either in reference to the body of the
laity or to the general extent of liberal studies in the church, and as it
involves a comparison with prior or subsequent ages, it cannot be improper
in such a sense, even if the manuscripts of the Bible should have been as
common in monasteries as Dr. Maitland supposes; and yet his proofs seem
much too doubtful to sustain that hypothesis.</p>

<p>There is a tendency to set aside the verdict of the most approved writers,
which gives too much of a polemical character, too much of the tone of an
advocate who fights every point, rather than of a calm arbitrator, to the
Letters on the Dark Ages. For it is not Henry, or Jortin, or Robertson,
who are our usual testimonies, but their immediate masters, Muratori, and
Fleury, and Tiraboschi, and Brucker and the Benedictine authors of the
Literary History of France, and many others in France, Italy, and Germany.
The latest who has gone over this rather barren ground, and not inferior
to any in well-applied learning, in candour or good sense, is M. Amp√®re,
in his Histoire Litt√©raire de la France avant le douzi√®me si√®cle (3 vols.
Paris, 1840). No one will accuse this intelligent writer of unduly
depreciating the ages which he thus brings before us; and by the perusal
of his volumes, to which Heeren and Eichhorn may be added for Germany, we
may obtain a clear and correct outline, which, considering the shortness
of life compared with the importance of exact knowledge on such a subject,
will suffice for the great majority of readers. I by no means, however,
would exclude the Letters on the Dark Ages, as a spirited pleading for
those who have often been condemned unheard.</p>

<p>I shall conclude by remarking that one is a little tempted to inquire why
so much anxiety is felt by the advocates of the medi√¶val church to rescue
her from the charge of ignorance. For this ignorance she was not,
generally speaking, to be blamed. It was no crime of the clergy that the
Huns burned their churches, or the Normans pillaged their monasteries. It
was not by their means that the Saracens shut up the supply of papyrus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
and that sheep-skins bore a great price. Europe was altogether decayed in
intellectual character, partly in consequence of the barbarian incursions,
partly of other sinister influences acting long before. We certainly owe
to the church every spark of learning which then glimmered, and which she
preserved through that darkness to re-kindle the light of a happier
age&mdash;<span class="grk">&Sigma;&pi;&#8051;&rho;&mu;&alpha;
&pi;&upsilon;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf;
&sigma;&#8061;&zeta;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&alpha;</span>. Meantime, what better apology than
this ignorance can be made by Protestants, and I presume Dr. Maitland is
not among those who abjure the name, for the corruption, the superstition,
the tendency to usurpation, which they at least must impute to the church
of the dark ages? Not that in these respects it was worse than in a less
obscure period; for the reverse is true; but the fabric of popery was
raised upon its foundations before the eleventh century, though not
displayed in its full proportions till afterwards. And there was so much
of lying legend, so much of fraud in the acquisition of property, that
ecclesiastical historians have not been loth to acknowledge the general
ignorance as a sort of excuse. [1848.]</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap"><a name="N1_2"></a>Note</span> II. Page 350.</p>

<p>The account of domestic architecture given in the text is very
superficial; but the subject still remains, comparatively with other
portions of medi√¶val antiquity, but imperfectly treated. The best sketch
that has hitherto been given is in an article with this title in the
Glossary of Ancient Architecture (which should be read in an edition not
earlier than that of 1845), from the pen of Mr. Twopeny, whose attention
has long been directed to the subject. "There is ample evidence yet
remaining of the domestic architecture in this country during the twelfth
century. The ordinary manor-houses, and even houses of greater
consideration, appear to have been generally built in the form of a
parallelogram, two stories high,<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
the lower story vaulted, with no
internal communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
between the two, the upper story approached by a
flight of steps on the outside; and in that story was sometimes the only
fireplace in the whole building. It is more than probable that this was
the usual style of houses in the preceding century." Instances of houses
partly remaining are then given. We may add to those mentioned by Mr.
Twopeny one, perhaps older than any, and better preserved than some, in
his list. At Southampton is a Norman house, perhaps built in the first
part of the twelfth century. It is nearly a square, the outer walls
tolerably perfect; the principal rooms appear to have been on the first
(or upper) floor; it has in this also a fireplace and chimney, and four
windows placed so as to indicate a division into two apartments; but there
are no lights below, nor any appearance of an interior staircase. The
sides are about forty feet in length. Another house of the same age is
near to it, but much worse
preserved.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p>The parallelogram house, seldom containing more than four rooms, with no
access frequently to the upper which the family occupied, except on the
outside, was gradually replaced by one on a different type:&mdash;the entrance
was on the ground, the staircase within; a kitchen and other offices,
originally detached, were usually connected with the hall by a passage running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
through the house; one or more apartments on the lower floor
extended beyond the hall; there was seldom or never a third floor over the
entire house, but detached turrets for sleeping-rooms rose at some of the
angles. This was the typical form which lasted, as we know, to the age of
Elizabeth, or even later. The superior houses of this class were sometimes
quadrangular, that is, including a court-yard, but seldom, perhaps, with
more than one side allotted to the main dwelling; offices, stables, or
mere walls filled the other three.</p>

<p>Many dwellings erected in the fourteenth century may be found in England;
but neither of that nor the next age are there more than a very few, which
are still, in their chief rooms, inhabited by gentry. But houses, which by
their marks of decoration, or by external proof, are ascertained to have
been formerly occupied by good families, though now in the occupation of
small farmers, and built apparently from the reign of the second to that
of the fourth Edward, are common in many counties. They generally bear the
name of court, hall, or grange; sometimes only the surname of some ancient
occupant, and very frequently have been the residence of the lord of the
manor.</p>

<p>The most striking circumstance in the oldest houses is not so much their
precautions for defence in the outside staircase, and when that was
disused, the better safeguard against robbery in the moat which frequently
environed the walls, the strong gateway, the small window broken by
mullions, which are no more than we should expect in the times, as the
paucity of apartments, so that both sexes, and that even in high rank,
must have occupied the same room. The progress of a regard to decency in
domestic architecture has been gradual, and in some respects has been
increasing up to our own age. But the medi√¶val period shows little of it;
though in the advance of wealth, a greater division of apartments
distinguishes the houses of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries from
those of an earlier period.</p>

<p>The French houses of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were probably
much of the same arrangement as the English; the middle and lower classes
had but one hall and one chamber; those superior to them had the solarium
or upper floor, as with us. See Arch√¶ological

<p>The Abb√© de Sade, in those copious memoirs of the life of Petrarch, which
illustrate in an agreeable though rather prolix manner the civil and
literary history of Provence and Italy in the fourteenth century,
endeavoured to establish his own descent from Laura, as the wife of Hughes
de Sade, and born in the family de Noves. This hypothesis has since been
received with general acquiescence by literary men; and Tiraboschi in
particular, whose talent lay in these petty biographical researches, and
who had a prejudice against every thing that came from France, seems to
consider it as decisively proved. But it has been called in question in a
modern publication by the late Lord Woodhouselee. (Essay on the Life and
Character of Petrarch, 1810.) I shall not offer any opinion as to the
identity of Petrarch's mistress with Laura de Sade; but the main position
of Lord W.'s essay, that Laura was an unmarried woman, and the object of
an honourable attachment in her lover, seems irreconcileable with the
evidence that his writings supply. 1. There is no passage in Petrarch,
whether of poetry or prose, that alludes to the virgin character of Laura,
or gives her the usual appellations of unmarried women, puella in Latin,
or donzella in Italian; even in the Trionfo della Castit√†, where so
obvious an opportunity occurred. Yet this was naturally to be expected
from so ethereal an imagination as that of Petrarch, always inclined to
invest her with the halo of celestial purity. We know how Milton took hold
of the mystical notions of virginity; notions more congenial to the
religion of Petrarch than his own:</p>

<p>2. The coldness of Laura towards so passionate and deserving a lover, if
no insurmountable obstacle intervened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
during his twenty years of
devotion, would be at least a mark that his attachment was misplaced, and
show him in rather a ridiculous light. It is not surprising, that persons
believing Laura to be unmarried, as seems to have been the case with the
Italian commentators, should have thought his passion affected, and little
more than poetical. But upon the contrary supposition, a thread runs
through the whole of his poetry, and gives it consistency. A love on the
one side, instantaneously conceived, and retained by the susceptibility of
a tender heart and ardent fancy; nourished by slight encouragement, and
seldom presuming to hope for more; a mixture of prudence and coquetry on
the other, kept within bounds either by virtue or by the want of mutual
attachment, yet not dissatisfied with fame more brilliant and flattery
more refined than had ever before been the lot of woman&mdash;these are surely
pretty natural circumstances, and such as do not render the story less
intelligible. Unquestionably such a passion is not innocent. But Lord
Woodhouselee, who is so much scandalized at it, knew little, one would
think, of the fourteenth century. His standard is taken not from Avignon,
but from Edinburgh, a much better place, no doubt, and where the moral
barometer stands at a very different altitude. In one passage (p. 188) he
carries his strictness to an excess of prudery. From all we know of the
age of Petrarch, the only matter of astonishment is the persevering virtue
of Laura. The troubadours boast of much better success with Proven√ßal
ladies. 3. But the following passage from Petrarch's dialogues with St.
Augustin, the work, as is well known, where he most unbosoms himself, will
leave no doubt, I think, that his passion could not have been gratified
consistently with honour. At mulier ista celebris, quam tibi certissimam

<p>The progress of our language in proceedings of the legislature is so well
described in the preface to the authentic edition of Statutes of the
Realm, published by the Record Commission, that I shall transcribe the
passage, which I copy from Mr. Cooper's useful account of the Public
Records (vol. i. p. 189):&mdash;</p>

<p>The earliest instance recorded of the use of the English language in any
parliamentary proceeding is in 36 Edw. III. The style of the roll of that
year is in French as usual, but it is expressly stated that the causes of
summoning the parliament were declared <i>en Englois</i>; and the like
circumstance is noted in 37 and 38 Edw.
III.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[d]</a>
In the 5th year of
Richard II., the chancellor is stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
to have made <i>un bone collacion en
Engleys</i> (introductory, as was then sometimes the usage, to the
commencement of business), though he made use of the common French form
for opening the parliament. A petition from the 'Folk of the Mercerye of
London,' in the 10th year of the same reign, is in English; and it appears
also that in the 17th year the Earl of Arundel asked pardon of the Duke of
Lancaster by the award of the King and Lords, in their presence in
parliament, in a form of English words. The cession and renunciation of
the crown by Richard II. is stated to have been read before the estates of
the realm and the people in Westminster Hall, first in Latin and
afterwards in English, but it is entered on the parliament roll only in
Latin. And the challenge of the crown by Henry IV., with his thanks after
the allowance of his title, in the same assembly, are recorded in English,
which is termed his maternal tongue. So also is the speech of Lord William
Thyrning, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, to the late King Richard,
announcing to him the sentence of his deposition, and the yielding up, on
the part of the people, of their fealty and allegiance. In the 6th year of
the reign of Henry IV. an English answer is given to a petition of the
Commons, touching a proposed resumption of certain grants of the crown to
the intent the king might live of his own. The English language afterwards
appears occasionally, through the reigns of Henry IV. and Henry V. In the
first and second and subsequent years of Henry VI., the petitions or
bills, and in many cases the answers also, on which the statutes were
afterwards framed, are found frequently in English; but the statutes are
entered on the roll in French or Latin. From the 23rd year of Henry VI.
these petitions or bills are almost universally in English, as is also
sometimes the form of the royal assent; but the statutes continued to be
enrolled in French or Latin. Sometimes Latin and French are used in the
same statute,<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>
as in 8 Hen. VI., 27 Hen. VI., and 39 Hen. VI. The last
statute wholly in Latin on record is 33 Hen. VI. c. 2. The statutes of
Edward IV. are entirely in French. The statutes of Richard III. are in many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
manuscripts in French in a complete statute form; and they were so
printed in his reign and that of his successor. In the earlier English
editions a translation was inserted in the same form; but in several
editions, since 1618, they have been printed in English, in a different
form, agreeing, so far as relates to the acts printed, with the inrolment
in Chancery at the Chapel of the Rolls. The petitions and bills in
parliament, during these two reigns, are all in English. The statutes of
Henry VII. have always, it is believed, been published in English; but
there are manuscripts containing the statutes of the first two
parliaments, in his first and third year, in French. From the fourth year
to the end of his reign, and from thence to the present time, they are
universally in English.</p>

<div class="footnotes">FOOTNOTES:

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_935_935" id="Footnote_935_935"></a><a href="#FNanchor_935_935"><span class="label">[a]</span></a> The writings of Lupus Servatus, abbot of Ferri√®res, were
published by Baluze; and a good account of them will be found in Amp√®re's
Hist. Litt. (vol. iii. p. 237), as well as in older works. He is a much
better writer than Gregory of Tours, but quite as much inferior to
Sidonius Apollinaris. I have observed in Lupus quotations from Horace,
Virgil, Martial, Cicero, Aulus Gellius, and Trogus Pompeius (meaning
probably Justin).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_936_936" id="Footnote_936_936"></a><a href="#FNanchor_936_936"><span class="label">[b]</span></a> This is rather equivocal, but it is certainly not meant
that there were ever two <i>floors</i> above that on the ground. In the review
of the "Chronicles of the Mayors and Sheriffs," published in the
Arch√¶ological Journal (vol. iv. p. 273), we read&mdash;"The houses in London,
of whatever material, seem never to have exceeded one story in height."
(p. 282.) But, soon afterwards&mdash;"The ground floor of the London houses at
this period was aptly enough called a cellar, the upper story a solar." It
thus appears that the reviewer does not mean the same thing as Mr. Twopeny
by the word <i>story</i>, which the former confines to the floor above that on
the ground, while the latter includes both. The use of language, as we
know, supports, in some measure, either meaning; but perhaps it is more
correct, and more common, to call the first story that which is reached by
a staircase from the ground-floor. The solar, or sleeping-room, raised
above the cellar, was often of wood.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_937_937" id="Footnote_937_937"></a><a href="#FNanchor_937_937"><span class="label">[c]</span></a> See a full description in the Arch√¶ological Journal, vol.
iv. p. 11. Those who visit Southampton may seek this house near a gate in
the west wall. We may add to the contribution of Mr. Twopeny one published
in the Proceedings of the Arch√¶ological Institute, by Mr. Hudson Turner,
Nov. 1847. This is chiefly founded on documents, as that of Mr. Twopeny is
on existing remains. These give more light where they can be found; but
the number is very small. Upon the whole, it may be here observed, that we
are frequently misled by works of fiction as to the domestic condition of
our forefathers. The house of Cedric the Saxon in Ivanhoe, with its
distinct and numerous apartments, is very unlike any that remain or can be
traced. This is by no means to be censured in the romancer, whose aim is
to delight by images more splendid than truth; but, especially when
presented by one who possessed in some respects a considerable knowledge
of antiquity, and was rather fond of displaying it, there is some danger
lest the reader should believe that he has a faithful picture before him.</p></div>
